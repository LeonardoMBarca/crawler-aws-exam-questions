In this approach, the consumer applications would still need to read directly from DynamoDB, creating tight coupling between the ingestion and consumption processes.\n\nOption D: It is the recommended solution for decoupling and scalability. The ingestion application can publish messages to an SNS topic, and multiple consumer apps can subscribe to the relevant SQS queues. SNS ensures that each message is delivered to all subscribed queues, allowing the consuming apps to independently process the messages at their own pace and scale horizontally as needed. This provides loose coupling, scalability, and fault tolerance, as the queues can handle message spikes and manage the consumption rate based on the consumer's processing capabilities.",

SNS with SQS provides these capabilities.\n\nPublishing messages to an SNS topic with multiple SQS subscriptions is a common AWS pattern for achieving both decoupling and scalability in message-driven systems. SNS allows messages to be fanned out to multiple subscribers, which in this case would be SQS queues. Each consumer application could then process messages from its SQS queue at its own pace, providing scalability and ensuring that all messages are processed by all consumer applications.\n\nA.

CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.

Aurora Auto Scaling allows the database to automatically add or remove Aurora Replicas based on the workload, ensuring that read requests can be distributed effectively and the database can scale to meet demand. This provides both high availability and automatic scaling to handle unpredictable read workloads.",

With C, the different endpoint have different IP addresses, and in case of failover, DNS would return the IP address of a different entry point. Thus failover might take longer with C, but again, the stem does not mention that failover must be fast ...",

When an RDS instance is stopped, you only pay the associated storage charges. In Amazon RDS, storage and backup charges are based on the amount of storage you use. Therefore, when you stop an RDS execution instance, you will still pay the costs associated with storage, but not the execution fees.\nIn contrast, if you use option C, which is to take a snapshot and terminate the instance, there may be costs associated with storing the snapshot and Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Overall, option A minimizes costs because when you stop an RDS execution instance, you only have to pay a relatively low storage cost rather than an execution fee.",

Restart the DB instance when required.\n\nHere's why option A is the most suitable choice:\n\nCost Reduction: Stopping the DB instance when not in use effectively reduces the cost to zero during the idle period. You only pay for storage when the instance is stopped. This is a cost-effective way to handle infrequent, resource-intensive tasks without incurring ongoing costs.\n\nPerformance Insights Enabled: This option allows you to keep Performance Insights enabled when the DB instance is stopped, which provides visibility into database performance. You can resume the instance and monitor performance during the testing period.",

AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. You can use AWS Config to create rules that automatically tag resources when they are created or when their configurations change.\n\nTo create tags for your resources using AWS Config, you will need to create an AWS Config rule that specifies the tag key and value you want to use and the resources you want to apply the tag to. You can then enable the rule and AWS Config will automatically apply the tag to the specified resources when they are created or when their configurations change.",

By creating a custom rule or using the built-in rule for tagging, you can define the required tags for EC2, RDS DB and Redshift clusters. AWS Config continuously monitors the resources and generates configuration change events or evaluation results.\n\nBy leveraging AWS Config, the solution can automatically detect any resources that do not comply with the defined tagging requirements. This approach eliminates the need for manual checks or periodic code execution, reducing operational overhead. Additionally, AWS Config provides the ability to automatically remediate non-compliant resources by triggering Lambda or sending notifications, further streamlining the configuration management process.\n\nOption B (using Cost Explorer) primarily focuses on cost analysis and does not provide direct enforcement of proper tagging.

Real-time Data Stream: To share millions of financial transactions with other apps, you need to be able to ingest data in real-time, which is made possible by Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.\n\n    2. Data Transformation: You can cleanse and eliminate sensitive data from transactions before storing them in Amazon DynamoDB by utilizing AWS Lambda with Kinesis Data Streams. This takes care of the requirement to handle sensitive data with care.\n    3. Scalability: DynamoDB and Amazon Kinesis are both extremely scalable technologies that can manage enormous data volumes and adjust to the workload.\n\n    4. Low-Latency retrieval: Applications requiring real-time data can benefit from low-latency retrieval, which is ensured by storing the processed data in DynamoDB.",

S3 Intelligent-Tiering stores objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access. For a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. There are no retrieval fees in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed later, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier. No additional tiering fees apply when objects are moved between access tiers within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is designed for 99.9% availability and 99.999999999% durability, and offers the same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard",

In this case, the web tier should only be able to access the database tier and not the other way around. Therefore, the security group for the web tier should only allow outbound traffic to the security group for the database tier on the necessary ports. Similarly, the security group for the database tier should only allow inbound traffic from the security group for the web tier on the necessary ports.\n\nAnswer C: Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on port 1433 from the security group for the web tier.

This allows for efficient utilization of resources and ensures that the application can handle increased workload and communication failures.\n\nCloudWatch is used to monitor the length of SQS. When queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential communication failures, the ASG can be configured to scale up by adding more instances to handle the load.\n\nD.

With RDS Proxy, failover times for Aurora and RDS databases are reduced by up to 66% and database credentials, authentication, and access can be managed through integration with AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).",

Here are some key points about using RDS Proxy with Aurora:\n\nRDS Proxy supports connecting to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL databases. This allows applications to connect to Aurora clusters via the proxy.\n\nUsing a proxy provides better scalability by allowing connections to be distributed among Aurora replica instances. It also improves availability since the proxy can direct connections to other Aurora replicas if the primary becomes unavailable.\n\nThe Aurora database and RDS Proxy must be in the same VPC to allow connections. Your applications can be deployed in the same VPC or a different one, as long as they have network access to the proxy.\n\nCertain regions and Aurora engine versions support RDS Proxy based on the database engine. You can check the AWS documentation for the latest supported versions in each region.",

Option D does not address this and cannot to my knowledge address it. Thus:\n\nA. Create an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Create a file share that uses the required client protocol. Connect the application server to the file share.\n\nBy using AWS Storage Gateway in file gateway mode, you can extend your on-premises data center storage into the AWS cloud. The file share created on AWS Storage Gateway can use the necessary client protocol (such as Lustre), which would allow the Lustre clients in your on-premises data center to access the data stored on AWS Storage Gateway.\n\nThis solution enables you to use Lustre clients to access data, while still keeping the gaming application hosted in your on-premises data center. AWS Storage Gateway provides a fully managed solution for this hybrid scenario, allowing seamless integration between on-premises and AWS cloud storage.",

Use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server.\n\nTo automate the process of transferring the data from the on-premises SFTP server to an EC2 instance with an EFS file system, you can use AWS DataSync. AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates transferring data between on-premises storage systems and Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.\n\nTo use AWS DataSync for this task, you should first install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.

To design a scalable and cost-effective solution for the batch processing job, the solutions architect should recommend implementing EC2 Spot Instances.\n\nEC2 Spot Instances allow users to bid on spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity and can be a cost-effective solution for stateless, interruptible workloads that can be started and stopped at any time. Since the batch processing job is stateless, can be started and stopped at any time, and typically takes upwards of 60 minutes to complete, EC2 Spot Instances would be a good fit for this workload.",

By setting up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years, the company can keep all data for at least 25 years while ensuring that data from the most recent 2 years remains highly available and immediately retrievable in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.

Enable SSE-S3 on the target S3 bucket if it is not already enabled. This will ensure all new or copied objects are encrypted automatically.\n2. Create an S3 inventory report for the source bucket containing the objects. This will generate a CSV file with metadata of all objects.\n3. Use S3 Select or AWS Athena to query the inventory report and filter for only unencrypted objects.\n4. Create an S3 Batch Operations job to copy the filtered unencrypted objects to the target bucket. The copy operation will automatically encrypt the objects using the bucket's SSE-S3 configuration.",

If you are unsure which instance type is most appropriate for your performance needs, our advice is to start with any On-Demand Instance for a month or two, and experiment with changing the Instance Type up or down to see it performs. The goal is to “dial into” the lowest cost instance type that meets your performance needs. We recommend that you purchase Reserved Instances only when you know you are going to use it close to 24×7 (or at least more than 75% of the time).",

By denying access to all Regions except ap-northeast-3, the company ensures that VPCs can only be deployed in the specified Region.\n\nOption B is incorrect because using rules in AWS WAF alone does not address the requirement of denying access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3.\n\nOption D is incorrect because configuring outbound rules in network ACLs and IAM policies for users can help restrict traffic and access, but it does not enforce the company's requirement of denying access to all Regions except ap-northeast-3.\n\nOption E is incorrect because using AWS Config and managed rules can help detect and alert for specific resources and configurations, but it does not directly enforce the restriction of internet access or deny access to specific Regions.",

With AWS Backup, you gain a fully managed, policy-based backup solution with snapshot scheduling and snapshot retention management. You can now create, manage, and restore Aurora backups directly from the AWS Backup console for both PostgreSQL-compatible and MySQL-compatible versions of Aurora.\nTo get started, select an Amazon Aurora cluster from the AWS Backup console and take an on-demand backup or simply assign the cluster to a backup plan.",

While taking manual snapshots can be useful for creating backups of the data, it is not a reliable or efficient way to meet the requirement of storing all the data for 5 years and deleting it after 5 years. It would be difficult to ensure that manual snapshots are taken regularly and retained for the required period of time.

It can be used to create and manage backup policies that specify when and how often snapshots should be created, as well as how long they should be retained. With Amazon DLM, you can easily and automatically create and manage backups of your EC2 instances and RDS DB instances in a separate Region, with minimal operational overhead.",

Overall, using Amazon DLM is likely to be the easiest and most efficient option for meeting the requirements with the least operational overhead.",

Configuring an SQS FIFO queue as a target for CloudTrail logs and using a function to send an alert to an SNS topic adds unnecessary complexity to the solution and increases operational overhead. Using EventBridge and SNS directly is a simpler and more efficient approach.",

Option D (correct answer)\n\nBy using an SQS queue and Lambda, the solutions architect can decouple the API front end from the processing microservices and improve the overall scalability and availability of the system. The SQS queue acts as a buffer, allowing the API front end to continue accepting user requests even if the processing microservices are experiencing high workloads or are temporarily unavailable. The Lambda function can then retrieve requests from the SQS queue and write them to DynamoDB, ensuring that all user requests are stored and processed. This approach allows the company to scale the processing microservices independently from the API front end, ensuring that the API remains available to users even during periods of high demand.",

All four options meet the \"not increase retrieval time\" requirement (even Glacier Instant Retrieval has \"the same latency and access time as S3 Standard\"). If data would be rarely accessed, B would be cheapest. If it would be constantly accessed, C would be cheapest (we'd pay the Intelligent Tiering fee but it would never move anything to a cheaper tier). Inbetween it would be D.\n\nBut I guess the key is Amazon's clear recommendation to use Intelligent Tiering (A) for \"unknown or changing access\" patterns, which matches the statement in the question.",

Once the data is transferred to S3, a lifecycle policy can be applied to automatically transition the files from the S3 Standard storage class to the cost-effective Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class.\n\nOption B would require continuous data transfer over the public internet, which could be time-consuming and costly given the large amount of data. It may also require significant bandwidth allocation.\n\nOption C would involve additional costs for provisioning and maintaining the dedicated connection, which may not be necessary for a one-time data migration.\n\nOption D could be a viable option, but it may incur additional costs for deploying and managing the DataSync agent.\n\nTherefore, option A is the recommended choice as it provides a secure and efficient data transfer method using Snowball devices and allows for cost optimization through lifecycle policies by transitioning the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive for long-term storage.",

This solution involves creating a new S3 and manually downloading and uploading all existing objects. It requires significant effort and time to transfer millions of objects, making it a less efficient solution.\n\nC. While enabling SSE with AWS KMS is a valid approach to encrypt objects in an S3, it does not address the requirement of encrypting existing objects.

Traffic always stays on the global AWS backbone, and never traverses the public internet, which reduces threats, such as common exploits, and DDoS attacks. Inter-Region VPC peering provides a simple and cost-effective way to share resources between regions or replicate data for geographic redundancy.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html",

It already has scheduled scaling that works well in this scenario. Scale down after working hours and scale up in working hours. So, it just needs to adjust the desired number to start from 20 instances.\n\nBut here is the point it shows A is WRONG!!!\nIf it started with desired 20 instances, it will keep it for the whole day. What if the load is reduced? We do not need to keep the 20 instances always. That 20 is the MAXIMUM number we need, no the DESIRE number. So it is against COST that is the main objective of this question.\n\nSo, the answer is C",

The Auto Scaling group then adjusts the capacity to maintain that target.\n\n    Lower CPU Threshold: By triggering the target tracking action at a lower CPU threshold, the Auto Scaling group can proactively add instances when the workload increases, helping to address the slowness at the beginning of the day.\n\n    Decrease Cooldown Period: Reducing the cooldown period allows the Auto Scaling group to scale in and out more rapidly, making adjustments quicker in response to changing demand.",

FSx for ONTAP file systems are similar to on-premises NetApp clusters. Within each file system that you create, you also create one or more storage virtual machines (SVMs). These are isolated file servers each with their own endpoints for NFS, SMB, and management access, as well as authentication (for both administration and end-user data access). In turn, each SVM has one or more volumes which store your data.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/storage/getting-started-cloud-file-storage-with-amazon-fsx-for-netapp-ontap-using-netapp-management-tools/",

The stored volume configuration stores the entire data set on-premises and asynchronously backs up the data to AWS. The cached volume configuration stores recently accessed data on-premises, and the remaining data is stored in Amazon S3.\n\nSince the company wants only its recently accessed data to remain stored locally, the cached volume configuration would be the most appropriate. It allows the company to keep frequently accessed data on-premises and reduce the need for scaling its iSCSI storage while still providing access to all data through the AWS cloud. This configuration also provides low-latency access to frequently accessed data and cost-effective off-site backups for less frequently accessed data.",

In this scenario, each quote type can be considered a subscriber. Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) queues can be subscribed to the SNS topic, and SNS message filtering can be used to direct messages to the appropriate SQS queue based on the quote type. This setup ensures that quotes are separated by quote type and that they are not lost. Each backend application server can then poll its own SQS queue to retrieve and process messages.

Amazon Inspector then generates a report that details any security vulnerabilities that were found and provides guidance on how to remediate them.\n\nBy configuring an AWS Lambda function, the company can automate the generation and distribution of reports that detail the findings. This means that reports can be generated and distributed as soon as vulnerabilities are detected, allowing the company to take action quickly.",

Among the options provided, option C provides a serverless solution using AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.

Configure the Lambda function to perform an extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to process the .csv files and store the processed data in the DynamoDB table.\nOption A is also a valid solution, but it may involve more operational overhead than Option C. With Option A, you would need to set up and manage an AWS Glue job, which would require more setup time than creating an AWS Lambda function. Additionally, AWS Glue jobs have a minimum execution time of 10 minutes, which may not be necessary or desirable for this use case.

With Session Manager, you can manage your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs).

Session Manager provides secure and auditable node management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys. Session Manager also allows you to comply with corporate policies that require controlled access to managed nodes, strict security practices, and fully auditable logs with node access details, while providing end users with simple one-click cross-platform access to your managed nodes. \nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html",

Lambda functions are well-suited for short-lived, stateless operations like generating thumbnails, and they can be triggered by various events, including image uploads. By using Lambda, the application can quickly confirm that the image was uploaded successfully and then asynchronously generate the thumbnail. When the thumbnail is generated, the Lambda function can send a message to the user to confirm that the thumbnail is ready.\n\nC proposes to use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) message queue to process image uploads and generate thumbnails. SQS can help decouple the image upload process from the thumbnail generation process, which is helpful for asynchronous processing. However, it may not be the most suitable option for quickly alerting the user that the image was received, as the user may have to wait until the thumbnail is generated before receiving a notification.",

Moving assets to S3 Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days: This storage class automatically analyzes the access patterns of objects and moves them between frequent access and infrequent access tiers. Since the objects will be accessed frequently for the first 30 days, storing them in the frequent access tier during that period optimizes performance. After 30 days, when the access patterns become inconsistent, S3 Intelligent-Tiering will automatically move the objects to the infrequent access tier, reducing storage costs.\n\nB. Configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads: Multipart uploads are used for large objects, and incomplete multipart uploads can consume storage space if not cleaned up. By configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads, unnecessary storage costs can be avoided.",

Here's a breakdown of Option B:\n\nB. Create a scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. Set the appropriate desired capacity, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity. Set the recurrence to weekly. Set the start time to 30 minutes before the batch jobs run.\n\n    Scheduled scaling allows you to change the desired capacity of your Auto Scaling group based on a schedule. In this case, setting the recurrence to weekly and adjusting the start time to 30 minutes before the batch jobs run will ensure that the necessary capacity is available when needed, without requiring manual intervention.",

In this context, the most suitable solution is C.\n\nPredictive Scaling can use historical data to forecast future capacity needs.\nConfiguring the policy to scale based on CPU utilization with a target value of 60% aligns with the baseline CPU utilization mentioned in the scenario.\nSetting instances to pre-launch 30 minutes before the jobs run provides the desired capacity just in time.",

Predictive scaling uses machine learning to predict capacity requirements based on historical data from CloudWatch.

AWS Global Accelerator is easy to set up, configure, and manage. It provides static IP addresses that provide a fixed entry point to your applications and eliminate the complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Global Accelerator always routes user traffic to the optimal endpoint based on performance, reacting instantly to changes in application health, your user's location, and policies that you configure. You can test the performance benefits from your location with a speed comparison tool. Like other AWS services, AWS Global Accelerator is a self-service, pay-per-use offering, requiring no long term commitments or minimum fees.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/",

They differ in performance characteristics and price, which means that you can tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your database workload. You can create MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL RDS DB instances with up to 64 tebibytes (TiB) of storage. You can create SQL Server RDS DB instances with up to 16 TiB of storage.
