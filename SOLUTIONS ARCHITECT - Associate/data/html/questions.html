   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.
   </li>
   <li>
    E.
												
											
											Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an Amazon ample Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.

   A company runs an online marketplace web application on AWS. The application serves hundreds of thousands of users during peak hours. The company needs a scalable, near-real-time solution to share the details of millions of financial transactions with several other internal applications. Transactions also need to be processed to remove sensitive data before being stored in a document database for low-latency retrieval.What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Store the transactions data into Amazon DynamoDB. Set up a rule in DynamoDB to remove sensitive data from every transaction upon write. Use DynamoDB Streams to share the transactions data with other applications.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to store data in Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3. Use AWS Lambda integration with Kinesis Data Firehose to remove sensitive data. Other applications can consume the data stored in Amazon S3.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every transaction and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Store the batched transactions data in Amazon S3 as files. Use AWS Lambda to process every file and remove sensitive data before updating the files in Amazon S3. The Lambda function then stores the data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume transaction files stored in Amazon S3.
   </li>
  </ul>

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   A company has two applications: a sender application that sends messages with payloads to be processed and a processing application intended to receive the messages with payloads. The company wants to implement an AWS service to handle messages between the two applications. The sender application can send about 1,000 messages each hour. The messages may take up to 2 days to be processed: If the messages fail to process, they must be retained so that they do not impact the processing of any remaining messages.Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Set up an Amazon EC2 instance running a Redis database. Configure both applications to use the instance. Store, process, and delete the messages, respectively.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Use an Amazon Kinesis data stream to receive the messages from the sender application. Integrate the processing application with the Kinesis Client Library (KCL).
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Integrate the sender and processor applications with an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure a dead-letter queue to collect the messages that failed to process.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Subscribe the processing application to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications to process. Integrate the sender application to write to the SNS topic.
   </li>

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   An image hosting company uploads its large assets to Amazon S3 Standard buckets. The company uses multipart upload in parallel by using S3 APIs and overwrites if the same object is uploaded again. For the first 30 days after upload, the objects will be accessed frequently. The objects will be used less frequently after 30 days, but the access patterns for each object will be inconsistent. The company must optimize its S3 storage costs while maintaining high availability and resiliency of stored assets.Which combination of actions should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   A transaction processing company has weekly scripted batch jobs that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The number of transactions can vary, but the baseline CPU utilization that is noted on each run is at least 60%. The company needs to provision the capacity 30 minutes before the jobs run.Currently, engineers complete this task by manually modifying the Auto Scaling group parameters. The company does not have the resources to analyze the required capacity trends for the Auto Scaling group counts. The company needs an automated way to modify the Auto Scaling group’s desired capacity.Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Create a dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. Configure the policy to scale based on the CPU utilization metric. Set the target value for the metric to 60%.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Create a scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. Set the appropriate desired capacity, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity. Set the recurrence to weekly. Set the start time to 30 minutes before the batch jobs run.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Create a predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. Configure the policy to scale based on forecast. Set the scaling metric to CPU utilization. Set the target value for the metric to 60%. In the policy, set the instances to pre-launch 30 minutes before the jobs run.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Create an Amazon EventBridge event to invoke an AWS Lambda function when the CPU utilization metric value for the Auto Scaling group reaches 60%. Configure the Lambda function to increase the Auto Scaling group’s desired capacity and maximum capacity by 20%.

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   A company is developing a new machine learning (ML) model solution on AWS. The models are developed as independent microservices that fetch approximately 1 GB of model data from Amazon S3 at startup and load the data into memory. Users access the models through an asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests and specify where the results should be sent.The company provides models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models are irregular. Some models could be unused for days or weeks. Other models could receive batches of thousands of requests at a time.Which design should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Direct the requests from the API to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by the NLB.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Direct the requests from the API to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use AWS App Mesh to scale the instances of the ECS cluster based on the SQS queue size.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by SQS events. Use AWS Auto Scaling to increase the number of vCPUs for the Lambda functions based on the SQS queue size.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from the queue. Enable AWS Auto Scaling on Amazon ECS for both the cluster and copies of the service based on the queue size.

   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Create a VPC peering connection between the VPCs that are in the primary account and the secondary account.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Create a second Lambda function in the secondary account that has a mount that is configured for the file system. Use the primary account's Lambda function to invoke the secondary account's Lambda function.

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   A company is designing an event-driven order processing system. Each order requires multiple validation steps after the order is created. An idempotent AWS Lambda function performs each validation step. Each validation step is independent from the other validation steps. Individual validation steps need only a subset of the order event information.The company wants to ensure that each validation step Lambda function has access to only the information from the order event that the function requires. The components of the order processing system should be loosely coupled to accommodate future business changes.Which solution will meet these requirements?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for each validation step. Create a new Lambda function to transform the order data to the format that each validation step requires and to publish the messages to the appropriate SQS queues. Subscribe each validation step Lambda function to its corresponding SQS queue.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the validation step Lambda functions to the SNS topic. Use message body filtering to send only the required data to each subscribed Lambda function.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Create an Amazon EventBridge event bus. Create an event rule for each validation step. Configure the input transformer to send only the required data to each target validation step Lambda function.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Create a new Lambda function to subscribe to the SQS queue and to transform the order data to the format that each validation step requires. Use the new Lambda function to perform synchronous invocations of the validation step Lambda functions in parallel on separate threads.
   </li>
  </ul>

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   A company is creating a prototype of an ecommerce website on AWS. The website consists of an Application Load Balancer, an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances for web servers, and an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance that runs with the Single-AZ configuration.The website is slow to respond during searches of the product catalog. The product catalog is a group of tables in the MySQL database that the company does not update frequently. A solutions architect has determined that the CPU utilization on the DB instance is high when product catalog searches occur.What should the solutions architect recommend to improve the performance of the website during searches of the product catalog?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Migrate the product catalog to an Amazon Redshift database. Use the COPY command to load the product catalog tables.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Implement an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster to cache the product catalog. Use lazy loading to populate the cache.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Add an additional scaling policy to the Auto Scaling group to launch additional EC2 instances when database response is slow.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Turn on the Multi-AZ configuration for the DB instance. Configure the EC2 instances to throttle the product catalog queries that are sent to the database.
   </li>
  </ul>

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   A company has an application that runs on an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster on Amazon EC2 instances. The application has a UI that uses Amazon DynamoDB and data services that use Amazon S3 as part of the application deployment.The company must ensure that the EKS Pods for the UI can access only Amazon DynamoDB and that the EKS Pods for the data services can access only Amazon S3. The company uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).Which solution meals these requirements?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Create separate IAM policies for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB access with the required permissions. Attach both IAM policies to the EC2 instance profile. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to control access to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB for the respective EKS Pods.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Create separate IAM policies for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB access with the required permissions. Attach the Amazon S3 IAM policy directly to the EKS Pods for the data services and the DynamoDB policy to the EKS Pods for the UI.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Create separate Kubernetes service accounts for the UI and data services to assume an IAM role. Attach the AmazonS3FullAccess policy to the data services account and the AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess policy to the UI service account.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Create separate Kubernetes service accounts for the UI and data services to assume an IAM role. Use IAM Role for Service Accounts (IRSA) to provide access to the EKS Pods for the UI to Amazon S3 and the EKS Pods for the data services to DynamoDB.
   </li>
  </ul>

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   A company is developing an application in the AWS Cloud. The application's HTTP API contains critical information that is published in Amazon API Gateway. The critical information must be accessible from only a limited set of trusted IP addresses that belong to the company's internal network.Which solution will meet these requirements?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Set up an API Gateway private integration to restrict access to a predefined set of IP addresses.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Create a resource policy for the API that denies access to any IP address that is not specifically allowed.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Directly deploy the API in a private subnet. Create a network ACL. Set up rules to allow the traffic from specific IP addresses.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Modify the security group that is attached to API Gateway to allow inbound traffic from only the trusted IP addresses.
   </li>
  </ul>
