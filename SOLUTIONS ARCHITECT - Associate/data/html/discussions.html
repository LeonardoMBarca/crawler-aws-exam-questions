     Keyword: 
From GLOBAL sites as quickly as possible in a SINGLE S3 bucket.
Minimize operational complexity

A. is correct because S3 Transfer Acceleration is support for high speed transfer in Edge location and you can upload it immediately. Also with multipart uploads your big file can be uploaded in parallel.
B, C, D. is not minimize operational and fast when compare to answer A

     General line: Collect huge amount of the files across multiple continents
Conditions: High speed Internet connectivity
Task: aggregate the data from all in a single S3 bucket
Requirements: as quick as possible, minimize operational complexity

Correct answer A: S3 Transfer Acceleration because:
- ideally works with objects for long-distance transfer (uses Edge Locations)
- can speed up content transfers to and from S3 as much as 50-500%
- use cases: mobile &amp; web application uploads and downloads, distributed office transfers, data exchange with trusted partners. Generally for sharing of large data sets between companies, customers can set up special access to their S3 buckets with accelerated uploads to speed data exchanges and the pace of innovation.

B - about disaster recovery
C - about transferring data between your local environment and the AWS Cloud
D - about disaster recovery

       C, we DO have a "local environment" (a "site") that collect data, and THAT data must go to "the AWS cloud". Why not C? The stem says nothing about large objects, which would be a requirement for the "multipart upload" that is mentioned.

     Explanation:
Option B suggests uploading the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. This ensures that the data is transferred quickly over high-speed Internet connections. By using S3 Cross-Region Replication, the objects can be automatically copied to the destination S3 bucket, allowing for easy aggregation. Once the data is successfully replicated, it can be removed from the origin S3 bucket to minimize storage costs and reduce complexity.

Option A is not the best choice because it only focuses on optimizing the upload to the destination S3 bucket by using S3 Transfer Acceleration and multipart uploads. However, it doesn't address the requirement of aggregating data from multiple sites.

     A specifically mentions "multipart upload", but the stem says nothing about large files. We have "sites" that collect a lot of sensor data. Wouldn't C be an option? Snowball Edge is tied to a region, so it can't upload directly to the central bucket. Copying the files onto Snowball Edge, then let Snowball Edge upload them to a bucket in its own region from where they would be replicated to the central bucket. This would meet the requirement of minimizing operational overhead.

(Options B and D are clearly out as they require manual intervention.)

       The Snowball family is used for petabyte-scale migrations so using Snowball is overkill. You can simply use transfer acceleration AND multi-part uploads to speed up S3 uploads as they are already features of the service.

     B: Cross region replication attracts extra costs to transfer data across regions. No need to choose this option as each site is having high speed connection. 
C. No need to go for device transfers as each site is having high speed connection. 
D. Not a good solution to use EBS volumes as we can transfer the data directly to S3. 
A is the best answer, especially going with multi-part upload, transferring the data to the destination bucket using transfer accelerator.

     A. Despite this option can be valid, it implies a bit of operational overhead compared with other options. Additionally, there is no need to aggregate that change to the existing architecture because we are already working in S3, and using other storage services incurs unnecessary costs. 

B. To collect the logs, we use CloudTrail over CloudWatch. Running SQL queries from the Amazon CloudWatch console is not recommended for this use case, since it is more used for filtering. 

C. Athena integrates seamlessly with S3 and allows you to run simple SQL queries in no time. When working with Apache Spark or with SQL in S3, using this service is the best option.

D. This option incurs elevated operational overhead. Glue is not used to catalog the logs. Analyzing logs with Spark on an EMR cluster is very common, but you can do it faster with the Athena service integrated with S3 directly.

     Answer: C

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena at your data stored in Amazon S3 and begin using standard SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds.

     Amazon Athena helps you analyze unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data stored in Amazon S3. Examples include CSV, JSON, or columnar data formats such as Apache Parquet and Apache ORC. You can use Athena to run ad-hoc queries using ANSI SQL, without the need to aggregate or load the data into Athena. It uses
Amazon QuickSight for data visualization
AWS Glue Data Catalog allows you to create tables and query data in Athena based on a central metadata store available

     Condition keys: AWS provides condition keys that you can query to provide more granular control over certain actions. 
The following condition keys are especially useful with AWS Organizations:

aws:PrincipalOrgID – Simplifies specifying the Principal element in a resource-based policy. This global key provides an alternative to listing all the account IDs for all AWS accounts in an organization. Instead of listing all of the accounts that are members of an organization, you can specify the organization ID in the Condition element.

aws:PrincipalOrgPaths – Use this condition key to match members of a specific organization root, an OU, or its children. The aws:PrincipalOrgPaths condition key returns true when the principal (root user, IAM user, or role) making the request is in the specified organization path. A path is a text representation of the structure of an AWS Organizations entity.

     use a new condition key, aws:PrincipalOrgID, in these policies to require all principals accessing the resource to be from an account (including the master account) in the organization. For example, let's say you have an Amazon S3 bucket policy and you want to restrict access to only principals from AWS accounts inside of your organization. To accomplish this, you can define the aws:PrincipalOrgID condition and set the value to your organization ID in the bucket policy. Your organization ID is what sets the access control on the S3 bucket. Additionally, when you use this condition, policy permissions apply when you add new accounts to this organization without requiring an update to the policy.

     Answered by ChatGPT with an explanation.

The correct solution that meets these requirements with the least amount of operational overhead is Option A: Add the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.

Option A involves adding the aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key to the S3 bucket policy, which allows you to specify the organization ID of the accounts that you want to grant access to the bucket. By adding this condition to the policy, you can limit access to the bucket to only users of accounts within the organization.

       Option B involves creating organizational units (OUs) for each department and adding the aws:PrincipalOrgPaths global condition key to the S3 bucket policy. This option would require more operational overhead, as it involves creating and managing OUs for each department.

Option C involves using AWS CloudTrail to monitor certain events and updating the S3 bucket policy accordingly. While this option could potentially work, it would require ongoing monitoring and updates to the policy, which could increase operational overhead.

         Option D involves tagging each user that needs access to the S3 bucket and adding the aws:PrincipalTag global condition key to the S3 bucket policy. This option would require you to tag each user, which could be time-consuming and could increase operational overhead.

Overall, Option A is the most straightforward and least operationally complex solution for limiting access to the S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization.

     This is the least operationally overhead solution because it requires only a single configuration change to the S3 bucket policy, which will allow access to the bucket for all users within the organization. The other options require ongoing management and maintenance. Option B requires the creation and maintenance of organizational units for each department. Option C requires monitoring of specific CloudTrail events and updates to the S3 bucket policy based on those events. Option D requires the creation and maintenance of tags for each user that needs access to the bucket.

     B. Create an organizational unit (OU) for each department. Add the AWS: Principal Org Paths global condition key to the S3 bucket policy. This solution allows for the S3 bucket to only be accessed by users within the organization in AWS Organizations while minimizing operational overhead by organizing users into OUs and using a single global condition key in the bucket policy. Option A, adding the Principal ID global condition key, would require frequent updates to the policy as new users are added or removed from the organization. Option C, using CloudTrail to monitor events, would require manual updating of the policy based on the events. Option D, tagging each user, would also require manual tagging updates and may not be scalable for larger organizations with many users.

     Option A, which suggests adding the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy, is a valid solution to limit access to the S3 bucket to users within the organization in AWS Organizations. It can effectively achieve the desired access control.

It restricts access to the S3 bucket based on the organization ID, ensuring that only users within the organization can access the bucket. This method is suitable if you want to restrict access at the organization level rather than individual departments or organizational units.

The operational overhead for Option A is also relatively low since it involves adding a global condition key to the S3 bucket policy. However, it is important to note that the organization ID must be accurately configured in the bucket policy to ensure the desired access control is enforced.

In summary, Option A is a valid solution with minimal operational overhead that can limit access to the S3 bucket to users within the organization using the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key.

     AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) now makes it easier for you to control access to your AWS resources by using the AWS organization of IAM principals (users and roles). For some services, you grant permissions using resource-based policies to specify the accounts and principals that can access the resource and what actions they can perform on it. Now, you can use a new condition key, aws:PrincipalOrgID, in these policies to require all principals accessing the resource to be from an account (including the master account) in the organization.

     A.	Correct answer. Bucket policy controls who can access to S3 and their objects. If we refer in the bucket policy to the organization, we can limit who can access inside that organization.
B.	Despite this option is correct, it is unnecessarily complex. We don't need to separate the AWS Organization users for the requirements imposed in the question. So, it only aggregates more operational overhead.
C.	Using CloudTrail for controlling the S3 access permissions is not suitable and require so many events to be monitored. Additionally, it only registers the logs, so CloudTrail cannot impose restrictions over the accounts that access to S3. 
D.	Tagging each user is not an scalable or efficient solution since you need to tag every user in the infrastructure, which is probably not static. Additionally, it makes unnecessary verbose the S3 bucket policy associated to that bucket.

     The answer is C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS.

The current architecture is using two separate EBS volumes, one for each EC2 instance. This means that each instance only has a subset of the documents. When a user refreshes the website, the Application Load Balancer will randomly direct them to one of the two instances. If the user's documents are not on the instance that they are directed to, they will not be able to see them.

     To ensure that users see all of their documents at once, the solutions architect should propose Option C: Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS.

Option C involves copying the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), and modifying the application to save new documents to EFS. Amazon EFS is a fully managed, scalable file storage service that allows you to store and access files from multiple EC2 instances concurrently. By moving the data to EFS and modifying the application to save new documents to EFS, the application will be able to access all of the documents from a single, centralized location, ensuring that users see all of their documents at once.

Overall, Option C is the most effective solution for ensuring that users see all of their documents at once.

       ***WRONG***
Option A involves copying the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents. This option would not solve the issue, as the data is still stored on two separate EBS volumes, and the application would still need to read from both volumes to retrieve all of the documents.

Option B involves configuring the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents. This option would not solve the issue, as the user may not always be directed to the server that has the documents they are looking for.

Option D involves configuring the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers and return each document from the correct server. This option would not be an efficient solution, as it would require the application to send requests to both servers and receive and process the responses from both servers, which could increase the load on the application.

second EC2 instance and EBS volume. They could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.

EBS: attached to one instance (special EBS io1, io2 can attached to multiple instances but not much)
EFS: can attached to multiple instances

A: Incorrect - EBS volumes don't have function to copy data from running EBS volume to running EBS volume. 
B: Incorrect - We can use sticky session to forward same user to the same server but when user lose the session the user might be forward to another server.
C: Correct - Because 2 instance now point to one EFS data storage, user will see both data.
D: Incorrect - We only use Traffic Mirroring to sent request to both servers. Application Load Balancer don't support send request to both servers because it's design it balance workload between server. And also ALB cannot combine document from both servers and return.

     Option A is not a good solution because copying data to both volumes would not ensure consistency of the data.

Option B would require the Load Balancer to have knowledge of which documents are stored on which server, which would be difficult to maintain.

Option C is a viable solution, but may require modifying the application to use Amazon EFS instead of EBS.

Option D is a good solution because it would distribute the requests to both servers and return the correct document from the correct server. This can be achieved by configuring session stickiness on the Load Balancer so that each user's requests are directed to the same server for consistency.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

       Sending requests to both servers can increase the response time since it would require checking two servers instead of one.
Session stickiness only works if the user has data in only one of the servers; otherwise, it would continue missing data.
Option C is not the best option, but is the one that fits better.

     EBS volumes must be in the same AZ as the instances they are attached to. So you cannot share an EBS across AZs. Unless you plan to have two separate volumes in each AZ, the simpliest solution is to use EFS as a shared file system that can be used across both AZs

     Let's analyse this:

B. On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.

C. File Gateway uses the Internet, so maximum speed will be at most 1Gbps, so it'll take a minimum of 6.5 days and you use 70TB of Internet bandwidth.

D. You can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbps with Direct Connect. Total time 15.5 hours and you will use 70TB of bandwidth. However, what's interesting is that the question does not specific what type of bandwidth? Direct Connect does not use your Internet bandwidth, as you will have a dedicate peer to peer connectivity between your on-prem and the AWS Cloud, so technically, you're not using your "public" bandwidth. 

The requirements are a bit too vague but I think that B is the most appropriate answer, although D might also be correct if the bandwidth usage refers strictly to your public connectivity.

       I will add that the question does not specify if the company already has DA in place or not. If they don't have DA in place, it will take a long time (weeks) for DA connectivity to be setup. Another point for B here, as Snowball is much quicker from this perspective.

     The question states that the storage is no longer growing. This implies that we don't need to make any kind of data synchronization. Additionally, the total storage is 70 TB, which is a large amount of data. This implies high transfer costs. So, we can discard A, C and D options.
Correct option: A. 
A Snowball device is a physical storage device which supports large data transfers. It is commonly used for transporting huge amounts of data from on-premises to AWS. Concretely, Snowball Edge is suitable for data transfers up to 80 TB. The transport times are between 1 and 2 weeks, so in case that we have hundreds of terabytes of data, we get them earlier than using Internet.
In case that we need to transfer petabytes of data, it is recommended to use AWS Snowmobile, which is a physical track that transports data, up to 10 PB.

     Select answer: B
Why? The essence of the S3 File Gateway is to provide a seamless interface for on-premises apps to store and retrieve data in Amazon S3 using standard protocols such as NFS and SMB. On the other hand,
As I write this, the first AWS Official use case for Snowball is to migrate data especially when network conditions are limited.

The question is a bit tricky. But applying simple logical linguistic analysis, "as soon as possible" coupled with "the least network bandwidth possible" means the question's focal point is network bandwidth. So, whatever the least network bandwidth is, it`s corresponding time to get the data into AWS S3 bucket is the value for  "as soon as possible".

       By default, an SQS queue can handle a maximum of 3,000 messages per second. However, you can request higher throughput by contacting AWS Support. AWS can increase the message throughput for your queue beyond the default limits in increments of 300 messages per second, up to a maximum of 10,000 messages per second.

It's important to note that the maximum number of messages per second that a queue can handle is not the same as the maximum number of requests per second that the SQS API can handle. The SQS API is designed to handle a high volume of requests per second, so it can be used to send messages to your queue at a rate that exceeds the maximum message throughput of the queue.

       D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

This solution uses Amazon SNS and SQS to publish and subscribe to messages respectively, which decouples the system and enables scalability by allowing multiple consumer applications to process the messages in parallel. Additionally, using Amazon SQS with multiple subscriptions can provide increased resiliency by allowing multiple copies of the same message to be processed in parallel.

     ***CORRECT ANSWER***
The correct solution that meets these requirements is Option D: Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

Option D involves using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) to decouple the solution and increase scalability. SNS is a fully managed, publish-subscribe messaging service that allows you to send messages to multiple recipients simultaneously. SQS is a fully managed, distributed message queue service that enables you to store, process, and transmit messages between microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

       To implement this solution, you would first publish the incoming messages to an SNS topic. You could then create multiple SQS subscriptions to the SNS topic, and configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues. This approach allows you to decouple the ingestion application from the consumer applications, and it allows you to scale the number of consumer applications independently of the ingestion application.

         ***WRONG AS EXPLAINED***
Option A involves persisting the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics and configuring the consumer applications to read and process the messages. This option would not be the most efficient solution, as it would require the consumer applications to continuously poll Kinesis Data Analytics for new messages, which could impact their performance.

Option B involves deploying the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics. This option would not decouple the solution and increase scalability, as the consumer applications would still be directly connected to the ingestion application.

           Option C involves writing the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with a single shard and using an AWS Lambda function to preprocess the messages and store them in DynamoDB. This option would not be the most efficient solution, as it would require the consumer applications to continuously poll DynamoDB for new messages, which could impact their performance.

Overall, Option D is the most effective solution for decoupling the solution and increasing scalability.

     Option A: It is more suitable for real-time analytics and processing of streaming data rather than decoupling and scaling message ingestion and consumption.

Option B: It may help with scalability to some extent, but it doesn't provide decoupling.

Option C: It is a valid option, but it lacks the decoupling aspect. In this approach, the consumer applications would still need to read directly from DynamoDB, creating tight coupling between the ingestion and consumption processes.

Option D: It is the recommended solution for decoupling and scalability. The ingestion application can publish messages to an SNS topic, and multiple consumer apps can subscribe to the relevant SQS queues. SNS ensures that each message is delivered to all subscribed queues, allowing the consuming apps to independently process the messages at their own pace and scale horizontally as needed. This provides loose coupling, scalability, and fault tolerance, as the queues can handle message spikes and manage the consumption rate based on the consumer's processing capabilities.

     The answer is D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.
This solution is the most scalable and decoupled solution for the given scenario. Amazon SNS is a pub/sub messaging service that can be used to decouple applications. Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that can be used to store and process messages.
The solution would work as follows:
    The ingestion application would publish the messages to an Amazon SNS topic.
    The Amazon SNS topic would have multiple Amazon SQS subscriptions.
    The consumer applications would subscribe to the Amazon SQS queues.
    The consumer applications would process the messages from the Amazon SQS queues.

     D. is the answer.
 The question states that there are dozens of other applications and microservices that consume these messages and that the volume of messages can vary drastically and increase suddenly. Therefore, you need a solution that can handle a high volume of messages, distribute them to multiple consumers, and scale quickly. SNS with SQS provides these capabilities.

Publishing messages to an SNS topic with multiple SQS subscriptions is a common AWS pattern for achieving both decoupling and scalability in message-driven systems. SNS allows messages to be fanned out to multiple subscribers, which in this case would be SQS queues. Each consumer application could then process messages from its SQS queue at its own pace, providing scalability and ensuring that all messages are processed by all consumer applications.

A. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is primarily used for real-time analysis of streaming data. It's not designed to distribute messages to multiple consumers.

     Option D

Amazon SNS allows you to publish messages to a topic, which can then fan out those messages to multiple subscribers.
By using Amazon SQS as a subscriber to the SNS topic, you can handle the message load in a decoupled and scalable way. SQS can store messages until the consuming application is ready to process them, helping to smooth out the variance in message load.
This approach allows the company to effectively decouple the message producing applications from the consuming applications, and it can easily scale to handle the high load of messages.
The number of messages (100,000 each second) might require careful configuration and sharding of SQS queues or use of FIFO queues to ensure that they can handle the load.
Options A, B, and C have their own limitations:

     D. Here's why option D is the correct choice:

Amazon SNS: Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables message publishing and subscription to topics. It provides fast and flexible communication between publishers and subscribers.
Amazon SQS: Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that decouples the components of a distributed application. It offers reliable and scalable queues for storing messages and enables applications to process them asynchronously.
By publishing the messages to an Amazon SNS topic and using Amazon SQS subscriptions, the solution achieves decoupling and scalability. Multiple applications and microservices can subscribe to the topic and receive messages through their individual SQS queues. This allows for parallel processing and enables the system to handle varying message volumes, including spikes of up to 100,000 messages per second.

     B. 
Explanation:
To maximize resiliency and scalability, the best solution is to use an Amazon SQS queue as a destination for the jobs. This decouples the primary server from the compute nodes, allowing them to scale independently. This also helps to prevent job loss in the event of a failure.

Using an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances for the compute nodes allows for automatic scaling based on the workload. In this case, it's recommended to configure the Auto Scaling group based on the size of the Amazon SQS queue, which is a better indicator of the actual workload than the load on the primary server or compute nodes. This approach ensures that the application can handle variable workloads, while also minimizing costs by automatically scaling up or down the compute nodes as needed.

    <p>
     <strong>
      Comment:
     </strong>
     SQS helps to process messages in case of variable workloads. The compute nodes must be implemented using EC2 instances (or alternatively, ECS tasks or managed Kubernetes nodes, but this option is not available). AutoScaling must be based on the workload, which is controlled by the queue. So, the correct option is B.
A is not correct because the instances should not scale based on a schedule which is not deterministic. On the contrary, scales based on the workload (queue size) is more effective. 
AWS CloudTrail should not be used as a destination job and it is not related to the question. The same applies to EventBridge.

     B:

Explanation:
Amazon SQS provides a reliable, highly scalable, and fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and coordinate the components of a distributed application.
EC2 Auto Scaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand, ensuring that your application can handle variable workloads efficiently.
Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue ensures that your application scales out when there are many jobs to process and scales in when the job load decreases, providing cost efficiency and responsiveness to workload changes.

     A lot of answer B's... 
but I'm not convinced its Ans B which states: “Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue” – because basing scaling on the size of the queue ignores the specific workload each job requires.  The problem states “The application serves variable workloads” – you can't determine the processing required for a variable workload based solely on queue size; this can only be done when you scope the size of the specific variable load – and that to my mind points to answer D: “Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the compute nodes” – but then I run into the (potential) problem that Eventbridge may not be up to the task…

The compute nodes can be managed in an Auto Scaling group, scaling based on the size of the SQS queue, which reflects the workload.

         Low-latency access is only required for the first 7 days, B maintains that fast access for 7 days and only then are the files sent to Glacier Archive

           It says low-latency is required for the most recently accessed files, not new ones. So if an older file is retrieved from deep archive, it should then readily be accessible, according to the question, which points toward Flexible retrieval. However the utility portion in the answer D is vague.

     The same question and answer explanation exists in a Udemy course.
Correct answer is B.
Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a seamless way to connect to the cloud to store application data files and backup images as durable objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage. Amazon S3 File Gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching.
It can be used for on-premises data-intensive Amazon EC2-based applications that need file protocol access to S3 object storage. Lifecycle policies can then transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

D is wrong because is involves too much extra configuration which is unnecessary.

     Option B, creating an Amazon S3 File Gateway and an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive, would meet the requirements specified in the prompt.

The S3 File Gateway allows you to store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using standard file system protocols, such as SMB and NFS. This would provide additional storage space for the company's data and allow for low-latency access to the most recently accessed files, as the data would still be stored on the SMB file server.

       Option A, using AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS, would not provide additional storage space for the company's data and would not allow for low-latency access to the most recently accessed files. 

Option C, creating an FSx for Windows File Server file system, would provide additional storage space but would not include file lifecycle management. 

Option D, installing a utility on each user's computer to access Amazon S3 and creating an S3 Lifecycle policy, would not provide additional storage space on the company's file server.

     Explanation:

Since the company needs to increase available storage space while maintaining low-latency access to recently accessed files and implement file lifecycle management to avoid future storage issues, the best solution is to use Amazon S3 with a File Gateway.

Using an Amazon S3 File Gateway, the company can access its SMB file server through an S3 bucket. This provides low-latency access to recently accessed files by caching them on the gateway appliance. The solution also supports file lifecycle management by using S3 Lifecycle policies to transition files to lower cost storage classes after they haven't been accessed for a certain period of time.

In this case, the company can create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days of not being accessed. This would allow the company to store large amounts of data at a lower cost, while still having easy access to recently accessed files.

     according to documentation the minimum storage timeframe for an object inside S3 before being able to transition using lifecycle policy is 30 days , so those 7 days policies kinda seem wrong to me


Transition actions – These actions define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you might choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after creating them, or archive objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class one year after creating them. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 storage classes. 


I was thinking of option A using DataSync as a scheduled task? am i wrong here?

      Comment:

     A.	DataSync is focused on transferring data when we need synchronization (for example, from an on-premises DB that updates daily to a DB in AWS). In this case, we don't need to transfer data or synchronize data, we only need to increase the storage. So, this option is not correct.
B.	S3 File Gateway allows communication between a File System/Server and S3, and it supports SMB protocol. We can use S3 FGW to move files from the FS to the S3 bucket. Then, the question says that files older than seven days are rarely accessed, so we can transition to S3 Glacier for those files to archive, in a costly-efficient way. So, this option is correct.
C.	You have two different storages for saving the files, making the interoperability unnecessarily more complex (and you need constant data synchronization, regarding to option A). 
D.	This is a mess. The solution is not scalable and It depends on the number of users, which is not a static number. Additionally, Flexible Retrieval is unnecessary.

     Explanation:

To ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received, the best solution is to use an Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. This type of queue maintains the exact order in which messages are sent and received.

In this case, the application can send information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST API, which can then use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon SQS FIFO queue for processing. The queue can then be configured to invoke an AWS Lambda function to perform the necessary processing on each order. This ensures that orders are processed in the exact order in which they are received.

     Explanation:
- Amazon API Gateway will be used to receive the orders from the web application.
- Instead of directly processing the orders, the API Gateway will integrate with an Amazon SQS FIFO queue.
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues in Amazon SQS ensure that messages are processed in the order they are received.
- By using a FIFO queue, the order processing is guaranteed to be sequential, ensuring that the first order received is processed before the next one.
- An AWS Lambda function can be configured to be triggered by the SQS FIFO queue, processing the orders as they arrive

     A.	This option could be correct if we use SNS FIFO option, but this is not the case stated in the question. Additionally, this task is more efficient done by a queue than a subscription service. So, this option is not correct.
B.	We use a queue, which is efficient processing messages. Additionally, it preserves the order since it is a FIFO queue. Meanwhile we don't have any kind of messages throughput limitation, this option is correct.
C.	This option discards any messages that are still processing, which is not a good solution.
D.	Same option as B but using a normal queue, which does not preserve the order. Incorrect.

     FIFO is crucial to ensuring the solution works.  
Two answers use SQS and the author has differentiated between these option by specifically stating in option B “FIFO”
On the other hand, SNS also has a FIFO option but the author has chosen to not state that in answer A.  If the author had said in option A: “…with FIFO” then A could have been a viable answer.  
Therefore it has to be Ans B (not A as the author recommends).

     Option A: Using AWS Secrets Manager and enabling automatic rotation is the recommended solution for minimizing the operational overhead of credential management. AWS Secrets Manager provides a secure and centralized service for storing and managing secrets, such as database credentials. By leveraging Secrets Manager, the application can retrieve the database credentials programmatically at runtime, eliminating the need to store them locally in a file. Enabling automatic rotation ensures that the database credentials are regularly rotated without manual intervention, enhancing security and compliance.

     Option A, using AWS Secrets Manager and turning on automatic rotation, would be the best solution to minimize the operational overhead of credential management.

AWS Secrets Manager is a service that makes it easier to manage secrets, such as database credentials, by storing and rotating them automatically. By turning on automatic rotation, you can ensure that the secrets are regularly rotated, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the database. This would minimize the operational overhead of credential management, as you would not have to manually rotate the secrets or update the EC2 instances with the new credentials.

     Everybody here voting A, but only the master user's password of the Aurora database can be automatically stored and rotated. Who uses the master user's credentials in their application ? It looks to me like a serious security issue...

Moreover answer A is not complete, missing steps are:
- create IAM role to get secret
- assign IAM role to EC2 instance
- adapt the application to retrieve the secret from Secrets Manager instead of erading the file
- make sure retrieval occurs every week
I dont' call that minimizing operational overhead... Answer D is a lot more simple.

In a real situation, none of these answers are relevant.

     The most suitable option for minimizing operational overhead of credential management in this scenario is:

B. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation.

AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is a service that helps you manage configuration data, including sensitive information such as passwords and database strings, in a central, secure store. With automatic rotation enabled, the credentials can be automatically updated at scheduled intervals, reducing the manual effort required for credential management.

     Answer is A
Explanation - AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
• They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
• Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
• CloudFront 
• Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) 
• Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
• Content is served at the edge
• Global Accelerator 
• Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP 
• Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
• Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
• Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses 
• Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

       By creating a CloudFront distribution that has both the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins, the company can reduce latency for both the static and dynamic data. The CloudFront distribution acts as a content delivery network (CDN), caching the data closer to the users and reducing the latency. The company can then configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution, providing improved performance for the web application.

     Q: How is AWS Global Accelerator different from Amazon CloudFront?

A: AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

- The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.
A: Correct - CloudFront has the Edge location and the cache for dynamic and static
B: Incorrect - AWS Global Accelerator don't have cache function, so static file need to be load directly from S3 every time.
- Beside that we configure CloudFront -&gt; ALB, Accelerator -&gt; S3, Route 53 -&gt; CloudFront. It means that all the traffic go to CloudFront only, Acclerator don't have any traffic.
C: Incorrect -  Global Accelerator can configure CloudFront as the endpoint.

     A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.

Here's the reasoning:

CloudFront with Multiple Origins: CloudFront allows you to set up multiple origins for your distribution, so you can use both the ALB (for dynamic content) and the S3 bucket (for static content) as origins. This means that both your dynamic and static content can be served through CloudFront, which will cache content at edge locations to reduce latency.
Route 53 Integration with CloudFront: Amazon Route 53 can be easily configured to route traffic for your domain to a CloudFront distribution. Users will access your domain, and Route 53 will direct them to the nearest CloudFront edge location.

Cloudfront supports multiple origins on the same distribution (ALB and S3) in our case.

     I'm wavering between A and C.
With dynamic content, CloudFront is cacheable and that's not good.
But with answer C, AWS Global doesn't support Cloudfront endpoint
"Endpoints for standard accelerators in AWS Global Accelerator can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. "
So I choose A

     Cloudfront caches content at edge locations, reduces latency, and can serve static content from S3 buckets. It can also accelerate dynamic content from EC2. CloudFront maintains a persistent pool of connections to the origin, which minimises the overhead of establishing new connections. Any of these questions with "latency" and "improve performance" smell like CloudFront.

     Answer is C
Explanation:
A: Using Cloudfront to cache static content is perfect for low latency and performance. However, caching dynamic content from ALB through cloudfront might not be efficient as dynamic contents is often personalized and are not good for caching.
B: Using cloudfront to cache dynamic contents from ALB is not the most efficient approach
C: Using amazon cloudfront to cache the static data from S3 ensures efficient distribution of static contents globally. AWS Global accelerator routes traffic to the nearest AWS EDGE location. Hence, routing is optimized to both the ALB (Dynamic contents) and Cloud front distribution.

     It would have made sense to use S3 bucket as the origin for cloud front and ALB as the end point for global accelerator. However the option C messes it up when it mentions also the cloud front distribution as the end point for global accelerator standard (which is not supported). As this is not possible the only option left is A to use Cloud front for both S3 &amp; ALB.

     AWS Secrets Manager is a secrets management service that enables you to store, manage, and rotate secrets such as database credentials, API keys, and SSH keys. Secrets Manager can help you minimize the operational overhead of rotating credentials for your Amazon RDS for MySQL databases across multiple Regions. With Secrets Manager, you can store the credentials as secrets and use multi-Region secret replication to replicate the secrets to the required Regions. You can then configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule so that the credentials are rotated automatically without the need for manual intervention. This can help reduce the risk of secrets being compromised and minimize the operational overhead of credential management.

AWS Secrets Manager allows you to store, manage, and rotate secrets, such as database credentials, across multiple AWS Regions. By enabling multi-Region secret replication, you can replicate the secrets across the required Regions to allow for seamless rotation of the credentials during maintenance activities. Additionally, Secrets Manager provides automatic rotation of secrets on a schedule, which would minimize the operational overhead of rotating the credentials on a monthly basis.

     With Secrets Manager, you can store, retrieve, manage, and rotate your secrets, including database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. When you create a secret using Secrets Manager, it's created and managed in a Region of your choosing. Although scoping secrets to a Region is a security best practice, there are scenarios such as disaster recovery and cross-Regional redundancy that require replication of secrets across Regions. Secrets Manager now makes it possible for you to easily replicate your secrets to one or more Regions to support these scenarios.

     Option C, using Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment and configuring Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas, would be the best solution to meet the requirements.

Aurora is a fully managed, MySQL-compatible relational database that is designed for high performance and high availability. Aurora Multi-AZ deployments automatically maintain a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone to provide high availability. Additionally, Aurora Auto Scaling allows you to automatically scale the number of Aurora Replicas in response to read workloads, allowing you to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability. This would provide an automated solution for scaling the database to meet the demand of the application while maintaining high availability.

With Multi-AZ deployment, the database is automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones for high availability. Aurora Auto Scaling allows the database to automatically add or remove Aurora Replicas based on the workload, ensuring that read requests can be distributed effectively and the database can scale to meet demand. This provides both high availability and automatic scaling to handle unpredictable read workloads.

     I would recommend option C: Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.

AWS Network Firewall is a managed firewall service that provides filtering for both inbound and outbound network traffic. It allows you to create rules for traffic inspection and filtering, which can help protect your production VPC.

Option A: Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service, not a traffic inspection or filtering service.

Option B: Traffic Mirroring is a feature that allows you to replicate and send a copy of network traffic from a VPC to another VPC or on-premises location. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.

Option D: AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that helps you to centrally configure and manage firewalls across your accounts. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.

     I agree with C.
**AWS Network Firewall** is a stateful, managed network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for your virtual private cloud (VPC) that you created in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or AWS Direct Connect.

     AWS Network Firewall is a managed network firewall service that allows you to define firewall rules to filter and inspect network traffic. You can create rules to define the traffic that should be allowed or blocked based on various criteria such as source/destination IP addresses, protocols, ports, and more. With AWS Network Firewall, you can implement traffic inspection and filtering capabilities within the production VPC, helping to protect the network traffic.

In the context of the given scenario, AWS Network Firewall can be a suitable choice if the company wants to implement traffic inspection and filtering directly within the VPC without the need for traffic mirroring. It provides an additional layer of security by enforcing specific rules for traffic filtering, which can help protect the production environment.

     - AWS Network Firewall is a managed network security service that provides stateful inspection of traffic and allows you to define firewall rules to control the traffic flow in and out of your VPC.
- With AWS Network Firewall, you can create custom rule groups to define specific operations for traffic inspection and filtering.
- It can perform deep packet inspection and filtering at the network level to enforce security policies, block malicious traffic, and allow or deny traffic based on defined rules.
- By integrating AWS Network Firewall with the production VPC, you can achieve similar functionalities as the on-premises inspection server, performing traffic flow inspection and filtering.

     I didn't realize the network firewall could do inspection, but here's what the documentation says:

AWS Network Firewall supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection, allowing customers to strengthen their security posture on AWS by improving visibility into encrypted traffic flows. You can use AWS Network Firewall to decrypt TLS sessions and inspect both inbound and outbound Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) traffic without the need to deploy or manage any additional network security infrastructure. Encryption and decryption happen on the same firewall instance natively, so traffic does not cross any network boundaries.

Has the question not been asking "in the AWS cloud", option B could be a correct option too, but a costlier one though as the user has to pay for network data for every bit of traffic replication between AWS cloud and on-prem location.

     If you have data in sources other than Amazon S3, you can use Athena Federated Query to query the data in place or build pipelines that extract data from multiple data sources and store them in Amazon S3. With Athena Federated Query, you can run SQL queries across data stored in relational, non-relational, object, and custom data sources.

Athena uses data source connectors that run on AWS Lambda to run federated queries. A data source connector is a piece of code that can translate between your target data source and Athena. You can think of a connector as an extension of Athena's query engine. Prebuilt Athena data source connectors exist for data sources like Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon DocumentDB, and Amazon RDS, and JDBC-compliant relational data sources such MySQL, and PostgreSQL under the Apache 2.0 license

     Option B is the correct answer because Amazon QuickSight's sharing mechanism is based on users and groups, not IAM roles. IAM roles are used for granting permissions to AWS resources, but they are not directly used for sharing QuickSight dashboards.

In option B, you create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight, connect all the data sources (Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL), and create new datasets. After publishing dashboards to visualize the data, you share them with appropriate users and groups. This approach allows you to control the access levels for different users, such as providing full access to the management team and limited access to the rest of the company. This solution meets the requirements specified in the question.

     Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-based business intelligence (BI) service that makes it easy to create and publish interactive dashboards that include data visualizations from multiple data sources. By using QuickSight, the company can connect to both Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and create new datasets that combine data from both sources. The company can then use QuickSight to create interactive dashboards that visualize the data and provide data insights.

To limit access to the visualizations, the company can use QuickSight's built-in security features. QuickSight allows you to define fine-grained access control at the user or group level. This way, the management team can have full access to all the visualizations, while the rest of the company can have only limited access.

     tricky question, Users, groups and roles can have access.
Viewing who has access to a dashboard
Use the following procedure to see which users or groups have access to the dashboard.

Open the published dashboard and choose Share at upper right. Then choose Share dashboard.

In the Share dashboard page that opens, under Manage permissions, review the users and groups, and their roles and settings.

You can search to locate a specific user or group by entering their name or any part of their name in the search box at upper right. Searching is case-sensitive, and wildcards aren't supported. Delete the search term to return the view to all users.

Amazon QuickSight is a business intelligence (BI) tool provided by AWS that allows you to create interactive dashboards and reports. It supports a variety of data sources, including Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, which are the data sources in the company's data lake.

Option A (Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight and share with IAM roles) is incorrect because it suggests sharing with IAM roles, which are more suitable for managing access to AWS resources rather than granting access to specific users or groups within QuickSight.

     My opinion is divided here, and I will explain:
Option C can be correct because glue crawler is used to access S3, and athena federated query is used to access RDS.
My problem with answer C is that it says:
"Generate Reports by using athena"
And I think that is not true. athena alone does not generate reports, it has to integrate with services such as quickSight and then it generates reports, therefore the answer is not written properly and I think C is a mistake.
Since C is wrong I think B is the correct answer.

     The correct option to meet this requirement is A: Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and attach the role to the EC2 instances.

An IAM role is an AWS resource that allows you to delegate access to AWS resources and services. You can create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and then attach the role to the EC2 instances. This will allow the EC2 instances to access the S3 bucket and the documents stored within it.

Option B is incorrect because an IAM policy is used to define permissions for an IAM user or group, not for an EC2 instance.

Option C is incorrect because an IAM group is used to group together IAM users and policies, not to grant access to resources.

     Below is the response from Amazon Q: 

To access S3 from an EC2 instance, you need to create an IAM role and associate that role with the EC2 instance. Here are the basic steps:
1. Create an IAM role and attach the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess or AmazonS3FullAccess managed policy to grant S3 access.
2. Launch the EC2 instance and select the IAM role you created during launch.
3. The instance will now have the permissions defined in the IAM role and you can access S3 from the instance.

       Some key points:
1. Attaching an IAM role is preferred over creating a resource-based policy for S3 access from EC2 as it provides centralized access management.
2. The instance will need internet access to communicate with S3. Make sure the associated security group and NACL rules allow outbound internet access.
3. Check AWS documentation for latest steps to create and associate an IAM role with an EC2 instance. The console and CLI provide options to automate this process.

 suggests creating an IAM policy directly and attaching it to the EC2 instances. While this might work, it's not the recommended approach. Using an IAM role is more secure and manageable.

     Always remember that you should associate IAM roles to EC2 instances.
An IAM role is an AWS resource that allows you to delegate access to AWS resources and services. You can create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and then attach the role to the EC2 instances. This will allow the EC2 instances to access the S3 bucket and the documents stored within it.

     Option A is the correct approach because IAM roles are designed to provide temporary credentials to AWS resources such as EC2 instances. By creating an IAM role, you can define the necessary permissions and policies that allow the EC2 instances to access the S3 bucket securely. Attaching the IAM role to the EC2 instances will automatically provide the necessary credentials to access the S3 bucket without the need for explicit access keys or secrets.

Option B is not recommended in this case because IAM policies alone cannot be directly attached to EC2 instances. Policies are usually attached to IAM users, groups, or roles.

Option C is not the most appropriate choice because IAM groups are used to manage collections of IAM users and their permissions, rather than granting access to specific resources like S3 buckets.

Option D is not the optimal solution because IAM users are intended for individual user accounts and are not the recommended approach for granting access to resources within EC2 instances.

     IAM Roles manage who/what has access to your AWS resources, whereas IAM policies control their permissions.

Therefore, a Policy alone is useless without an active IAM Role or IAM User.

     To design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process images automatically, a solutions architect could consider the following actions:

Option A involves creating an SQS queue and configuring the S3 bucket to send a notification to the queue when an image is uploaded. This allows the application to decouple the image upload process from the image processing process and ensures that the image processing process is triggered automatically when a new image is uploaded. 

Option B involves configuring the Lambda function to use the SQS queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, the message is deleted from the queue. This ensures that the Lambda function is invoked only once per image and that the image is not processed multiple times.

       Option C is incorrect because it involves storing state (the file name) in memory, which is not a durable or scalable solution.

Option D is incorrect because it involves launching an EC2 instance to monitor the SQS queue, which is not a stateless solution.

Option E is incorrect because it involves using Amazon EventBridge (formerly Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send an alert to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, which is not related to the image processing process.

           A stateless system sends a request to the server and relays the response (or the state) back without storing any information. On the other hand, stateful systems expect a response, track information, and resend the request if no response is received

     Explanation:

    Option A: By creating an Amazon SQS queue and configuring the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded, the system establishes a durable and scalable way to handle incoming image processing tasks.

    Option B: Configuring the Lambda function to use the SQS queue as the invocation source allows it to retrieve messages from the queue and process them in a stateless manner. After successfully processing the image, the Lambda function can delete the message from the queue to avoid duplicate processing.

     A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.

Explanation:

A (SQS Queue): Using SQS to decouple the S3 bucket from the processing components provides durability and scalability. When an image is uploaded, a notification is sent to the SQS queue.
B (Lambda with SQS Trigger): Configuring the Lambda function to use the SQS queue as the invocation source allows for stateless and scalable image processing. Lambda can be triggered by messages in the SQS queue, and upon successful processing, the message can be deleted, ensuring that each message (image) is processed once.
This combination ensures a durable, stateless, and scalable architecture for processing images automatically in response to user uploads.

     Option A is a correct because it allows for decoupling between the image upload process and image processing. By configuring S3 to send a notification to SQS, image upload event is recorded and can be processed independently by microservice.

Option B is also a correct because it ensures that Lambda is triggered by messages in SQS. Lambda can retrieve image information from SQS, process and compress image, and store compressed image in a different S3. Once processing is successful, Lambda can delete processed message from SQS, indicating that image has been processed.

Option C is not recommended because it introduces a stateful approach by using a text file to keep track of processed images.

Option D is not optimal solution as it introduces unnecessary complexity by involving an EC2 to monitor SQS and maintain a text file.

Option E is not directly related to requirement of processing images automatically. Although EventBridge and SNS can be useful for event notifications and further processing, they don't provide the same level of durability and scalability as SQS.

     It's D, Coz.. Gateway Load Balancer is a new type of load balancer that operates at layer 3 of the OSI model and is built on Hyperplane, which is capable of handling several thousands of connections per second. Gateway Load Balancer endpoints are configured in spoke VPCs originating or receiving traffic from the Internet. This architecture allows you to perform inline inspection of traffic from multiple spoke VPCs in a simplified and scalable fashion while still centralizing your virtual appliances.

     The solution that will meet these requirements with the least operational overhead is D: Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC and create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.

A Gateway Load Balancer is a fully managed service that provides a single point of contact for clients and distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances and containers, in one or more virtual private clouds (VPCs). You can deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC and create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets from the web servers in the application's VPC and forward the packets to the appliance for packet inspection. This will allow you to inspect all traffic to the web application with minimal operational overhead.

     D. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.

A Gateway Load Balancer can inspect traffic before forwarding it to a virtual appliance for additional processing. The solution will not require changing the existing architecture and will have the least amount of operational overhead. The appliance can be configured with a specific IP interface to accept IP packets. The Gateway Load Balancer can be configured with an endpoint to route incoming packets to the appliance. The solution ensures all traffic to the web application is inspected before it reaches the web server.

     In the scenario described, the web servers, application servers, and database servers are all located within the same VPC. Therefore, a Gateway Load Balancer may not be the most suitable choice for load balancing traffic between them.

Instead, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) would be a better option as it operates at Layer 7 and can inspect traffic at the application layer. This would allow the virtual firewall to inspect traffic before it reaches the web servers, which is the requirement specified in the scenario.

Overall, while a Gateway Load Balancer can be useful in certain scenarios, it is not the best choice for this particular use case. An Application Load Balancer is a better option as it provides the necessary features to integrate the web application with the virtual firewall appliance and inspect all traffic before it reaches the web server.

     Here's why 
Traffic enters the service consumer VPC through the internet gateway.
Traffic is sent to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, as a result of ingress routing.
Traffic is sent to the Gateway Load Balancer for inspection through the security appliance.
Traffic is sent back to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint after inspection.
Traffic is sent to the application servers (destination subnet).

     This is the answer of ChatGpt:
Option B is the correct solution because the ALB can be used to redirect traffic to the virtual firewall appliance without requiring any changes to the backend application servers. The ALB can also be configured to send traffic to multiple targets, allowing the architect to perform high availability and load balancing. This solution is easy to implement and manage and does not require any additional components such as transit gateways or gateway load balancers.
Option D is not the optimal solution since Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) is intended for use with virtual appliances in the cloud, such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. However, it adds operational overhead since creating and managing a Gateway Load Balancer requires several components, including an endpoint group and listener.

     A. Create a Network Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.

By creating a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in the public subnet, you can configure it to forward incoming traffic to the virtual firewall appliance for inspection. The NLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and can distribute traffic across multiple instances, including the firewall appliance. This allows you to scale the inspection capacity if needed. The NLB can be associated with a target group that includes the IP address of the firewall appliance, directing traffic to it before reaching the web servers.

Option B (Application Load Balancer) is not suitable for this scenario as it operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and does not provide direct access to the IP packets for inspection.

Option C (Transit Gateway) and option D (Gateway Load Balancer) introduce additional complexity and overhead compared to using an NLB. They are not necessary for achieving the requirement of inspecting traffic to the web application before reaching the web servers.

     The correct answer is D.
Here is the explanation:
    Option D is correct because a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) is a global service, and it can be deployed in any VPC. This means that the GWLB can reach the appliance. Additionally, the GWLB can be configured to forward packets to the appliance for packet inspection.

    Option A is incorrect because a Network Load Balancer (NLB) is a regional service, and the appliance is deployed in an inspection VPC. This means that the NLB would not be able to reach the appliance.
    Option B is incorrect because an Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a regional service, and the appliance is deployed in an inspection VPC. This means that the ALB would not be able to reach the appliance.
    Option C is incorrect because a transit gateway is a global service, and the appliance is deployed in an inspection VPC. This means that the transit gateway would not be able to reach the appliance.

     Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB): GWLB is designed for deploying third-party appliances and provides a scalable and easy way to route traffic through appliances. It operates at the network layer and can handle both TCP and UDP traffic.
Operational Overhead: Deploying a GWLB in the inspection VPC and creating an endpoint involves less operational overhead compared to managing Load Balancers in the application's VPC. It allows for centralized management of the inspection process.
This solution ensures that all traffic is routed through the Gateway Load Balancer for inspection before reaching the web servers, providing a scalable and efficient way to integrate the third-party virtual firewall appliance

t support cross-VPC traffic routing

Option C -transit gateway attached to VPC,updating route table and configure security groups and network ACLs can accomplish the task.

Meanwhile, Gateway load balancer is designed meant for routing traffic across VPC, but itself alone does not work. All effort mentioned is C are still required. So this is not the least effort?

     Ans B – (a) because it's at the right level, ie. application level packet inspection; (b) it states “packet inspection” and fulfils the conditions: 
-“LEAST operational overhead”
-“…to inspect all traffic to the application before the traffic reaches the web” 

GLB won't do it – because it states “receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance” – ie. NO inspection: the application gets the packet (good or bad!).

Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore (FSR) enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized at creation. This eliminates the latency of I/O operations on a block when it is accessed for the first time. Volumes that are created using fast snapshot restore instantly deliver all of their provisioned performance.

- Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment.
- Minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.

A: Incorrect - we can do this But it is not minimize the time as requirement.
B: Incorrect - This approach use same EBS volumes for produciton and test. If we modify test then it will be affected prodution environment.
C: Incorrect - EBS snapshot will create new EBS volumes. It can not restore from existing volumes.
D: Correct - Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots -&gt; no latency on first use

     The correct answer is D.
Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to clone production data into a test environment using EBS snapshots:
    Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes.
    Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots.
    Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes.
    Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment.
The EBS fast snapshot restore feature allows you to restore snapshots more quickly than the default method. This is because the feature uses a process called parallel restore, which allows multiple EBS volumes to be restored at the same time.
The EBS fast snapshot restore feature is only available for EBS snapshots that are created in the same AWS Region as the EC2 instances that you are using to restore the snapshots.

     Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment.

Enabling the EBS fast snapshot restore feature allows you to restore EBS snapshots into new EBS volumes almost instantly, without needing to wait for the data to be fully copied from the snapshot. This significantly reduces the time required to clone the production data.

By taking EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes and restoring them into new EBS volumes in the test environment, you can ensure that the cloned data is separate and does not affect the production environment. Attaching the new EBS volumes to the EC2 instances in the test environment allows you to access the cloned data.

     The solution that will meet these requirements with the least operational overhead is D: Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's static content, deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution, set the S3 bucket as the origin, and use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

Using Amazon S3 to host static content and Amazon CloudFront to distribute the content can provide high performance and scale for websites with millions of requests each hour. Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda can be used to build scalable and highly available backend APIs to support the website, and Amazon DynamoDB can be used to store the data. This solution requires minimal operational overhead as it leverages fully managed services that automatically scale to meet demand.

       Option A is incorrect because using multiple S3 buckets to host the full website would not provide the required performance and scale for millions of requests each hour with millisecond latency.

Option B is incorrect because deploying the full website on EC2 instances and using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an RDS database would require more operational overhead to maintain and scale the infrastructure.

Option C is incorrect because while deploying the application in containers and hosting them on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) can provide high performance and scale, it would require more operational overhead to maintain and scale the infrastructure compared to using fully managed services like S3 and CloudFront.

     Option D:
Use Amazon S3 to store the website's static content (like images, HTML, etc.). Static content doesn't change based on user input, so S3 is perfect because it's highly scalable and can handle millions of requests.
Use Amazon CloudFront to distribute the content globally, reducing latency by delivering it from servers close to the user.
For backend operations (like placing orders), use API Gateway and Lambda functions. API Gateway handles incoming requests, while Lambda runs code without needing servers (it's serverless), which automatically scales to meet the traffic demand.
Store the data in DynamoDB: DynamoDB is a fully managed, NoSQL database that can handle huge traffic spikes with very fast performance, which is important for millions of visitors.

(1) So S3 can host static website? also is it mentioned on the question?
(2) Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, all service managed by AWS, but so what, same with (1), which component host the main page?

     Least operational overhead is only possible with managed services that deliver the required solution.
A: Cannot store order data in S3 as there is no processing in S3
B: Overhead of EC2 and RDS and ALB, too many moving parts
C: Container management is overhead and RDS too
D: S3 for static is best practice. CloudFront helps with scaling. API GW with Lambda is fully managed. DynamoDB for transactions is managed scalable solution.

     So in this question, how do you know FOR SURE that the website is static because it does not give you any clues. I know the API gateway makes the most sense with "millions of requests each hour", but it's very vague and leaves a grey area if the web site is static or not.

It also meets the resiliency requirement: "S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive redundantly store objects on multiple devices across a minimum of three Availability Zones in an AWS Region" https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/DataDurability.html

     The storage option that meets these requirements is B: S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns. It can store objects in two access tiers: the frequent access tier and the infrequent access tier. The frequent access tier is optimized for frequently accessed objects and is charged at the same rate as S3 Standard. The infrequent access tier is optimized for objects that are not accessed frequently and are charged at a lower rate than S3 Standard.

S3 Intelligent Tiering is a good choice for storing media files that are accessed frequently and infrequently in an unpredictable pattern because it automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns, minimizing storage and retrieval costs. It is also resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone because it stores objects in multiple Availability Zones within a region.

Option C, S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA), is not a good choice because it is optimized for infrequently accessed objects and does not offer the cost optimization of S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

Option D, S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA), is not a good choice because it is not resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. It stores objects in a single Availability Zone, making it less durable than other storage classes.

     (B) The question mentions that some files are accessed frequently while others are rarely accessed, and the pattern is unpredictable.
This makes S3 Intelligent-Tiering a good fit because it automatically moves data between different access tiers based on how frequently they are accessed, optimizing costs.
Intelligent-Tiering is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.
B meets the requirements

     S3 Intelligent-Tiering: This storage class is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving objects between two access tiers based on their usage patterns. It uses frequent access and infrequent access tiers. The frequently accessed objects stay in the frequent access tier, while the objects that are not accessed frequently are moved to the infrequent access tier. Intelligent-Tiering maintains high availability across AZs, just like S3 Standard, but it also helps reduce costs by moving data to the lower-cost tier when appropriate.

     The storage solution that will meet these requirements most cost-effectively is B: Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month.

Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 storage class for long-term retention of data that is rarely accessed and for which retrieval times of several hours are acceptable. It is the lowest-cost storage option in Amazon S3, making it a cost-effective choice for storing backup files that are not accessed after 1 month.

You can use an S3 Lifecycle configuration to automatically transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month. This will minimize the storage costs for the backup files that are not accessed frequently.

       Option A, configuring S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically migrate objects, is not a good choice because it is not designed for long-term storage and does not offer the cost benefits of S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Option C, transitioning objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 1 month, is not a good choice because it is not the lowest-cost storage option and would not provide the cost benefits of S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Option D, transitioning objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 month, is not a good choice because it is not the lowest-cost storage option and would not provide the cost benefits of S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

because objects that are archived to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval and S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval are charged for a minimum storage duration of 90 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive has a minimum storage duration of 180 days.

C - seems to provide graphs and the best option available, as...
D - could provide graphs, BUT involves operational overhead, which has been requested to be minimised.

         Never be over-confident! check the below AWS link, which mentions the below.
Cost Explorer allows customers to understand their spend for the past 14 days at the most granular hourly level. You can monitor your hourly cost and usage to determine appropriate SP/RI commitment or understand peak hour usage.

       B. This is correct because there is no limit of 14 days. Quoted from Amazon "AWS prepares the data about your costs for the current month and the last 12 months, and then calculates the forecast for the next 12 months." (https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/).

     Option B:
Use AWS Cost Explorer, a tool that makes it easy to view your costs and break them down into categories like EC2 instance types, time periods, and more.
With Cost Explorer, you can easily filter the information to see which EC2 instance types caused the increase in costs over the last two months. This lets you do an in-depth analysis without much effort.

     I would have gone for Ans B but apparently the right one is Ans C.  
I'm not convinced because neither B or C actually determine the root cause – they just point you in the right direction and then you'll need to do some further analysis around resource demand (CPU, storage, network, etc), data/network traffic, what function/ instructions are actually being processed, along with taking a view of the scaling algorithms.  On that basis I'd have said Ans B because it requires the LEAST overhead to get to the next step which is the one that matters: the root analysis for vertical scaling.

     The answer is B.
You can enable Cost Explorer for your account using this procedure on the Billing and Cost Management console. You can't enable Cost Explorer using the API. After you enable Cost Explorer, AWS prepares the data about your costs for the current month and the last 12 months, and then calculates the forecast for the next 12 months. The current month's data is available for viewing in about 24 hours. The rest of your data takes a few days longer. Cost Explorer updates your cost data at least once every 24 hours.

     The option that provides the least operational overhead for generating a graph comparing the last 2 months of EC2 costs based on instance types is:

D. Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to create a report and send it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon S3 as a source to generate an interactive graph based on instance types.

This option leverages the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to export detailed billing information to an Amazon S3 bucket. Then, using Amazon QuickSight, you can easily create interactive graphs and perform in-depth analysis based on instance types. This approach provides flexibility and customization in analyzing the cost data with minimal operational overhead.

     In order to clarify why some chosen C, the limitation is only meant for HOURLY COST.
"By enabling hourly granularity you can view your hourly costs up to the past 14 days to track costs during nights or off peak hours."

     A - refactoring can be a solution, BUT requires a LOT of effort - not the answer
B - DynamoDB is NoSQL and Aurora is SQL, so it requires a DB migration... again a LOT of effort, so no the answer
C and D are similar in structure, but...
C uses SNS, which would notify the 2nd Lambda function... provoking the same bottleneck... not the solution
D uses SQS, so the 2nd lambda function can go to the queue when responsive to keep with the DB load process. 
Usually the app decoupling helps with the performance improvement by distributing load. In this case, the bottleneck is solved by uses queues... so D is the answer.

     Keywords: 
- Company has to increase the Lambda quotas significantly to handle the high volumes of data that the company needs to load into the database.
- Improve scalability and minimize the configuration effort.

A: Incorrect - Lambda is Serverless and automatically scale - EC2 instance we have to create load balancer, auto scaling group,.. a lot of things. using native Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) drivers don't improve the performance.
B: Incorrect - a lot of things to changes and DynamoDB Accelerator use for cache(read) not for write.
C: Incorrect - SNS is use for send notification (e-mail, SMS).
D: Correct - with SQS we can scale application well by queuing the data.

     It could be C or D, but Ans D wins because 
–SNS is Push Mechanism - ‘Other Lambda' function is forced to take message when it might not be ready (or refuse it) 
–SQS is Pull Mechanism – ‘Other Lambda' function can take next message when its ready to do so 
SQS is simple and allows better de-coupling.

     D. Set up two Lambda functions, one for receiving information and another for loading data into the database. Integrate them using an Amazon SQS queue. This approach allows for better scalability, maintains the serverless paradigm, and minimizes manual configuration effort. It leverages Amazon SQS as a reliable message queue between Lambda functions.

Options A and B introduce complexities and changes in architecture, while Option C introduces an additional service that may not be as suitable for decoupling processes in this scenario.

     SQS will help Lambda scale even more. 
A EC2  + Tomcat will be slower than Lambda for this usecase
B is wrong because the problem is with Lambda scaling not the DB
C SNS is not the best option for this usecase when SQS is an option

     Sorry, but the question does not make sense by itself. What are you asking for more scalability from an already scalable Lambda function? 

If you're concerned about the concurrency limits of Lambda function, decoupling just doesn't make sense, since it'll keep even more lambda instances running in a given time period(including 2 phases of execution for each request, let alone the cold start issues).

If you're concerned about bottleneck database induced, that'll even be more ridiculous since you're supposed to resolve the scalability issue of the database(e.g. Aurora) instead of decoupling the Lambda function to improve the throughput of this entire data flow.

       i think it is clear that he want to enhance the lambda even more than "The default concurrency limit across all functions per region in a given account is 1,000"
cause sqs can scale and store the data till new available revoked lambda consume it

     I think B would be better solution.
How splitting one function into 2 increase scalability when company already increased service quota? Effectively they will have same compute time.
Changing Aurora to DAX will shorten the time for data loads by ~100x requiring way less time for data loading, and it's most time consuming thing this lambda does. DAX has better scaling than aurora and is better fit with lambda

     Lambda Functions: A review  
Run your code in response to events  

You can build chatbots using Lambda functions to process user input, execute business logic, and generate responses.  
Scales automatically  
They can be triggered in response to API events  
Lambda functions can process files as they are uploaded to S3 buckets. This is often used for tasks like image resizing, data extraction, or file validation.

     The solution that will accomplish this goal is A: Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules.

AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. You can use AWS Config to monitor and record changes to the configuration of your Amazon S3 buckets. By turning on AWS Config and enabling the appropriate rules, you can ensure that your S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.

       AWS Trusted Advisor (Option B) is a service that provides best practice recommendations for your AWS resources, but it does not monitor or record changes to the configuration of your S3 buckets.

Amazon Inspector (Option C) is a service that helps you assess the security and compliance of your applications. While it can be used to assess the security of your S3 buckets, it does not monitor or record changes to the configuration of your S3 buckets.

Amazon S3 server access logging (Option D) enables you to log requests made to your S3 bucket. While it can help you identify changes to your S3 bucket, it does not monitor or record changes to the configuration of your S3 bucket.

     AWS Config provides a detailed inventory of the company's AWS resources and configuration history, and can be configured with rules to evaluate resource configurations for compliance with policies and best practices.

The solutions architect can enable AWS Config and configure rules specifically checking for S3 bucket settings like public access blocking, encryption settings, access control lists, etc. AWS Config will record configuration changes to S3 buckets over time, allowing the company to review changes and be alerted about any unauthorized modifications.

     AWS Config is a service that provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your account. By enabling AWS Config, you can capture configuration changes and maintain a record of resource configurations over time. It allows you to define rules that check for compliance with desired configurations and can generate alerts or automated actions when unauthorized changes occur.

To accomplish the goal of preventing unauthorized configuration changes in Amazon S3 buckets, you can configure AWS Config rules specifically for S3 bucket configurations. These rules can check for a variety of conditions, such as ensuring that encryption is enabled, access control policies are correctly configured, and public access is restricted.

While options B, C, and D offer valuable services for various aspects of AWS deployment, they are not specifically focused on preventing unauthorized configuration changes in Amazon S3 buckets as effectively as enabling AWS Config.

       But this link also says All people who you share the dashboard with are granted these permissions for the account. If you share the dashboard publicly, then everyone who has the link to the dashboard has these permissions.

The cloudwatch:GetMetricData and ec2:DescribeTags permissions cannot be scoped down to specific metrics or EC2 instances, so the people with access to the dashboard can query all CloudWatch metrics and the names and tags of all EC2 instances in the account. If that is the case, how is the least privilege principle applicable?

     correct answer B
the reason A is not a good answer is: 
when sharing a link to the CloudWatch dashboard the following warning appears
We recommend that you do not share dashboards if your account contains any sensitive information which you would not wish to share with the users with whom you are sharing the dashboard.
The users that you specified above will be granted the following permissions: CloudWatch read-only permissions to alarms and contributor insights rules in the Dashboard which you share, and to all metrics and the names and tags of all EC2 instances in your account even if they are not shown in the Dashboard which you share. We recommend that you consider whether it is appropriate to make this information available to the users with whom you are sharing.
so following the least privilege principle, creating an IAM User in option B is more secure

     For anyone thinking it's B. Go and look at the permissions that cloud watch read only access gives you, there is about 20 different ones including from other services e.g. SNS.
Sharing the dashboard gives you 4 permissions by default, hence A is the correct answer and actually the recommended method of sharing dashboards.
Of course you can then continue to edit the policy after you have shared the dashboard to limit permissions even further, but yes, A is the correct.

     A is definitely NOT the answer. 

A. Sharing the dashboard from the CloudWatch console and providing a shareable link to the product manager may not align with the principle of least privilege. This method could potentially expose other dashboards or resources in the CloudWatch console that the product manager does not need access to.

     Tricky question!!! forget one-way or two-way. In this scenario, AWS applications (Amazon Chime, Amazon Connect, Amazon QuickSight, AWS Single Sign-On, Amazon WorkDocs, Amazon WorkMail, Amazon WorkSpaces, AWS Client VPN, AWS Management Console, and AWS Transfer Family) need to be able to look up objects from the on-premises domain in order for them to function. This tells you that authentication needs to flow both ways. This scenario requires a two-way trust between the on-premises and AWS Managed Microsoft AD domains.
It is a requirement of the application

       AWS IAM Identity Center requires a two-way trust so that it has permissions to read user and group information from your domain to synchronize user and group metadata. IAM Identity Center uses this metadata when assigning access to permission sets or applications. User and group metadata is also used by applications for collaboration, like when you share a dashboard with another user or group. The trust from AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory to your domain permits IAM Identity Center to trust your domain for authentication. The trust in the opposite direction grants AWS permissions to read user and group metadata.

     Answer B  as we have AWS SSO which requires two way trust. As per documentation - A two-way trust is required for AWS Enterprise Apps such as Amazon Chime, Amazon Connect, Amazon QuickSight, AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), Amazon WorkDocs, Amazon WorkMail, Amazon WorkSpaces, and the AWS Management Console. AWS Managed Microsoft AD must be able to query the users and groups in your self-managed AD.

Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and Amazon FSx will work with either a one-way or two-way trust.

     Option A suggests enabling AWS SSO and using a one-way trust, which allows AWS SSO to rely on the on-premises Microsoft Active Directory for authentication while keeping the management centralized in AWS SSO. This is a common and recommended approach for integrating on-premises Active Directory with AWS SSO.

       A -  Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

If the health status changes or you make configuration updates, AWS Global Accelerator reacts instantaneously to route your users to the next available endpoint.

     CloudFront uses Edge Locations to cache content while Global Accelerator uses Edge Locations to find an optimal pathway to the nearest regional endpoint. CloudFront is designed to handle HTTP protocol meanwhile Global Accelerator is best used for both HTTP and non-HTTP protocols such as TCP and UDP. so i think A is a better answer

     Its UDP so ALB is not applicable here which means BD are wrong
C using CF that uses latency record as origin? Makes no sense
B NLB autoscaling and AWS GA is best used for lower latency and scaling.

       It IS NLB. You cannot trust the "official" answers. I am not even sure why they bother giving them

Application Load Balancer:
-Web applications with layer 7 routing (HTTP/HTTPS)
-Microservices architectures (e.g. Docker containers)
-Lambda targets

Network Load Balancer:
-TCP and UDP based applications
-Ultra low latency
-Static IP addresses
-VPC endpoint services

     "The company needs to route users to the Region with the lowest latency. The company also needs automated failover between Regions." IMO both A and C would meet both requirements. The main difference is that with A, the IP address stays the same - in case of failover, it would be routed to a different entry point. With C, the different endpoint have different IP addresses, and in case of failover, DNS would return the IP address of a different entry point. Thus failover might take longer with C, but again, the stem does not mention that failover must be fast ...

     C - Create a manual Snapshot of DB and shift to S3- Standard and Restore form Manual Snapshot when required.

Not A - By stopping the DB although you are not paying for DB hours you are still paying for Provisioned IOPs , the storage for Stopped DB is more than Snapshot of underlying EBS vol.  and Automated Back ups .

     Most cost effective is to create a snapshot and get rid of the DB instance after testing.

     Answer C because,
You can stop a DB instance for up to seven days. If you don't manually start your DB instance after seven days, your DB instance is automatically started so that it doesn't fall behind any required maintenance updates.

So, the "auto starting" behaviour is expected.

If you rarely use the database, BEST option is to Snapshot and Delete the database. Then, when you need it again, you could launch a new database from the Snapshot.

Amazon RDS is not intended to be stopped for long periods.

     Option A (Stop and Restart) is less operationally complex and provides a quicker way to resume the database. It's suitable if the primary concern is operational simplicity and quick availability.
    Option C (Snapshot, Terminate, and Restore) may offer higher cost savings, especially if the instance is large and expensive to run, as you're avoiding charges for the time the instance is down. However, it comes with higher operational complexity and longer lead times to bring the database back online.

In Amazon RDS, you do incur charges for a DB instance even when it's stopped. This is a key distinction from Amazon EC2, where you are not charged for instance hours while an EC2 instance is stopped. For RDS, the charges related to the instance's storage and backups continue to accrue even when the instance itself is not running.

     Database not used by any other applications/processes, only use 48 hours per month while still need the same compute and RAM for intense testing =&gt; stop and start the instance will be the most cost effective. Option C needs to pay for snapshot of DB and more complex for what purpose?

     The Answer is A.
Option A does reduce costs when RDS is not running, because RDS does not charge execution fees when it is not running. When an RDS instance is stopped, you only pay the associated storage charges. In Amazon RDS, storage and backup charges are based on the amount of storage you use. Therefore, when you stop an RDS execution instance, you will still pay the costs associated with storage, but not the execution fees.
In contrast, if you use option C, which is to take a snapshot and terminate the instance, there may be costs associated with storing the snapshot and Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Overall, option A minimizes costs because when you stop an RDS execution instance, you only have to pay a relatively low storage cost rather than an execution fee.

     A. Stop the DB instance when tests are completed. Restart the DB instance when required.

Here's why option A is the most suitable choice:

Cost Reduction: Stopping the DB instance when not in use effectively reduces the cost to zero during the idle period. You only pay for storage when the instance is stopped. This is a cost-effective way to handle infrequent, resource-intensive tasks without incurring ongoing costs.

Performance Insights Enabled: This option allows you to keep Performance Insights enabled when the DB instance is stopped, which provides visibility into database performance. You can resume the instance and monitor performance during the testing period.

     Answer from ChatGPT:

Yes, you can use AWS Config to create tags for your resources. AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. You can use AWS Config to create rules that automatically tag resources when they are created or when their configurations change.

To create tags for your resources using AWS Config, you will need to create an AWS Config rule that specifies the tag key and value you want to use and the resources you want to apply the tag to. You can then enable the rule and AWS Config will automatically apply the tag to the specified resources when they are created or when their configurations change.

       This the first answer that I've seen ChatGPT get correct here on ExamTopics. You should all know that using ChatGPT for this is bound to give bad answers. It only parrots what it has seen written/copied/pasted by someone/something somewhere, picked up with absolutely zero context. ChatGPT doesn't "know" anything about AWS services. So, beware the "answers" it gives.

     AWS Config provides a set of pre-built or customizable rules that can be used to check the configuration and compliance of AWS resources. By creating a custom rule or using the built-in rule for tagging, you can define the required tags for EC2, RDS DB and Redshift clusters. AWS Config continuously monitors the resources and generates configuration change events or evaluation results.

By leveraging AWS Config, the solution can automatically detect any resources that do not comply with the defined tagging requirements. This approach eliminates the need for manual checks or periodic code execution, reducing operational overhead. Additionally, AWS Config provides the ability to automatically remediate non-compliant resources by triggering Lambda or sending notifications, further streamlining the configuration management process.

Option B (using Cost Explorer) primarily focuses on cost analysis and does not provide direct enforcement of proper tagging. Option C and D (writing API calls and running them manually or through scheduled Lambda) require more manual effort and maintenance compared to using AWS Config rules.

AWS Config (required_tag)
AWS Config is a service that allows you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources (see Resource types supported by AWS Config). In the case of tagging, we can use it to identify resources that are lacking tags with specific keys, using the required_tags rule (refer to Resource types supported by required_tags). From the earlier example, we might test for the existence of the key on all Amazon EC2 instances.

     Option A is the most appropriate solution to accomplish the given requirement because AWS Config Rules provide a way to evaluate the configuration of AWS resources against best practices and company policies. In this case, a custom AWS Config rule can be defined to check for proper tag allocation on Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS DB instances, and Amazon Redshift clusters. The rule can be configured to run periodically and notify the responsible parties when a resource is not properly tagged.

     The MOST cost-effective method for hosting a website is to:
Create an Amazon S3 bucket and host the website there.
Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and cost-effective object storage service. It is a good option for hosting static websites, such as the website in this scenario.
To host a static website on Amazon S3, you would first need to create an S3 bucket. Then, you would need to upload the website files to the bucket. Once the files are uploaded, you can configure the bucket to serve as a website.

You only pay for the storage and data transfer associated with your website, without the need for managing and maintaining web servers or containers. This reduces the operational overhead and infrastructure costs.

Containerizing the website and hosting it in AWS Fargate (option A) would involve additional complexity and costs associated with managing the container environment and scaling resources. Deploying a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance (option C) would require provisioning and managing the EC2 instance, which may not be cost-effective for a static website. Configuring an Application Load Balancer with an AWS Lambda target (option D) adds unnecessary complexity and may not be the most efficient solution for hosting a static website.

     I would go for C. The tricky phrase is "near-real-time solution", pointing to Firehouse, but it can't send data to DynamoDB, so it leaves us with C as best option. 

Kinesis Data Firehose currently supports Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Splunk, Datadog, NewRelic, Dynatrace, Sumologic, LogicMonitor, MongoDB, and HTTP End Point as destinations.

         Stream is used if you want real time results , but with firehose , you generally use the data at a later point of time by storing it somewhere. Hence if you see "REAL TIME" the answer is most probably Kinesis Data Streams.

     One of the tricky phrases is 'near-real-time solutions' because it points to the fact that every time a write is made to a database, it incurs a delay, and then retrieving it with an API call adds another latency. With Kinesis Data Streams, that process is optimized because the intermediary that gives you the ability to write to DynamoDB also provides that data to other services due to the retention period of Kinesis Data Streams.

     Ans C.  
High level difference between the Kinesis and DynamoDB:
Kinesis Streams allows production/ consumption of large volumes of data (web data, logs, etc); DynamoDB Streams is a feature local to DynamoDB to track the granular changes to DynamoDB table items.
(Note also: data latency for Firehose is 60 seconds or higher;  Streams is for custom processing and has sub-second processing latency).

As some commented already, 'near-real-time' could make you think abut Firehose but its consumers are 3rd-party partners destinations, Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch and HTTP endpoint so DynamoDB can't be used in this scenario.

     C is the best solution for the following reasons:

1. Real-time Data Stream: To share millions of financial transactions with other apps, you need to be able to ingest data in real-time, which is made possible by Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.

2. Data Transformation: You can cleanse and eliminate sensitive data from transactions before storing them in Amazon DynamoDB by utilizing AWS Lambda with Kinesis Data Streams. This takes care of the requirement to handle sensitive data with care.
3. Scalability: DynamoDB and Amazon Kinesis are both extremely scalable technologies that can manage enormous data volumes and adjust to the workload.

     C is the best solution for the following reasons:

    1. Real-time Data Stream: To share millions of financial transactions with other apps, you need to be able to ingest data in real-time, which is made possible by Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.

    2. Data Transformation: You can cleanse and eliminate sensitive data from transactions before storing them in Amazon DynamoDB by utilizing AWS Lambda with Kinesis Data Streams. This takes care of the requirement to handle sensitive data with care.
    3. Scalability: DynamoDB and Amazon Kinesis are both extremely scalable technologies that can manage enormous data volumes and adjust to the workload.

    4. Low-Latency retrieval: Applications requiring real-time data can benefit from low-latency retrieval, which is ensured by storing the processed data in DynamoDB.

       Choices A, B, and D are limited in certain ways:
    • Real-time data streaming is not provided by Option A (DynamoDB with Streams); additional components would need to be implemented in order to handle data in real-time.
    • Kinesis Data Firehose, Option B, lacks the real-time processing capabilities of Kinesis Data Streams and is primarily used for data distribution to destinations like as S3.
    • For near-real-time use cases, Option D (Batch processing with S3) is not the best choice. It adds latency and overhead associated with batch processing, which is incompatible with the need for real-time data sharing.
Using the advantages of Lambda, DynamoDB, and Kinesis Data Streams, Option C offers a scalable, real-time, and effective solution for the given use case.

AWS Config for Configuration Changes: AWS Config is a service that tracks changes to resource configurations over time. It provides a history of configuration changes to your AWS resources and helps with compliance and auditing by allowing you to assess how resource configurations have changed over time.

AWS CloudTrail for API Calls: AWS CloudTrail is designed specifically for recording API calls made to AWS resources. It captures detailed information about who made each API call, the actions taken, and the resources affected. This is essential for auditing and security purposes.

     To meet the requirement of tracking configuration changes on AWS resources and recording a history of API calls, a solutions architect should recommend option B: Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and AWS CloudTrail to record API calls.

Option A (using CloudTrail to track configuration changes and Config to record API calls) is incorrect because CloudTrail is specifically designed to capture API call history, while Config is designed for tracking configuration changes.

Option C (using Config to track configuration changes and CloudWatch to record API calls) is not the recommended approach. While CloudWatch can be used for monitoring and logging, it does not provide the same level of detail and compliance tracking as CloudTrail for recording API calls.

Option D (using CloudTrail to track configuration changes and CloudWatch to record API calls) is not the optimal choice because CloudTrail is the appropriate service for tracking configuration changes, while CloudWatch is not specifically designed for recording API call history.

     AWS Config is a fully managed service that allows the company to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of its AWS resources. It provides a detailed inventory of the resources in use and tracks changes to resource configurations. AWS Config can detect configuration changes and alert the company when changes occur. It also provides a historical view of changes, which is essential for compliance and governance purposes.

AWS CloudTrail is a fully managed service that provides a detailed history of API calls made to the company's AWS resources. It records all API activity in the AWS account, including who made the API call, when the call was made, and what resources were affected by the call. This information is critical for security and auditing purposes, as it allows the company to investigate any suspicious activity that might occur on its AWS resources.

     Option A is incorrect because Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that focuses on identifying malicious activity and unauthorized behavior within AWS accounts. While it is useful for detecting various security threats, it does not specifically address large-scale DDoS attacks.

Option B is also incorrect because Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability assessment service that helps identify security issues and vulnerabilities within EC2. It does not directly protect against DDoS attacks.

Option C is not the optimal choice because AWS Shield provides basic DDoS protection for resources such as Elastic IP addresses, CloudFront, and Route53 hosted zones. However, it

       I'd say D because multi-region keys can be used with server side encryption as well.

"Multi-Region keys are supported in the AWS KMS console, the AWS KMS API, the AWS Encryption SDK, Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client, and Amazon S3 Encryption Client. AWS services also let you configure multi-Region keys for server-side encryption in case you want the same key to protect data that needs both server-side and client-side encryption."

         Answer is D : This option aligns with the requirement to use a customer-managed KMS key for encryption.
It also ensures that the same KMS key is used for encryption and decryption across both AWS Regions, as required.
By using SSE-KMS, you can ensure that encryption keys are managed by AWS KMS, providing greater control and security over the encryption process.
Configuring replication between the S3 buckets ensures that data is synchronized across both regions.
This approach minimizes operational overhead while meeting the specified requirements.

       How does client side encryption increase OPERATIONAL overhead? Do you think every connected client is sitting there with gpg cli, decrypting/encrypting every packet that comes in/out? No, it's done via SDK -&gt; https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html

The correct answer is B because that's the only way to actually get the same key across multiple regions with minimal operational overhead

         "The data in both S3 buckets must be encrypted and decrypted with the same KMS key"
Client side encryption means that key is generated in from the cient without storing that in the KMS...

         It could be server side. For client side, the application need to finish the encryption and decryption by itself. So S3 object encryption on the server side is less operational overhead. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingClientSideEncryption.html

But for option B, the major issue is if you create KMS keys in 2 regions, they can not be the same.

       The data in both S3 buckets must be encrypted and decrypted with the same KMS key. 
AWS KMS supports multi-Region keys, which are AWS KMS keys in different AWS Regions that can be used interchangeably – as though you had the same key in multiple Regions. 
"as though" means it's different.
So  I agree with B

         B includes replicating the data in the S3 buckets, which is not mentioned anywhere in the stem. It says that you need to store data in two buckets, not that you need to replicate content between buckets.

     The Correct answer is D. The key requirement is: "The company must use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt all data that is stored in the S3 buckets." KMS doesn't work for client side encryption!!!

     It is D
Create a customer managed KMS key in AWS KMS.
Configure your Amazon S3 buckets to use this CMK for server-side encryption (SSE-KMS).
During data uploads, specify the CMK as the encryption key using the --sse-kms-key-id parameter.
This ensures consistent encryption and decryption across both S3 buckets in different regions.
You'll have full control over the key, including rotation, access controls, and cross-account access. https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-object-encryption-keys

     I think the answer was all stated clear in the question per sya.
" The data and the key must be stored in each of the two Regions." make it really clear it's either C or D. 
Since the customer "must use AWS kMS customer managed key to encrypt all data...", the answer should be D.

Basically, from two sources above, none mention to use KMS Multi Region (Option B), and client-side encryption. 
Option C is not really valid because SSE-S3 is AWS managed not customer managed.
Option D is the most logical and straightforward solution, you can create customer managed SSE-KMS.

       Without requiring direct SSH connection, securely access and control EC2 instances with AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.

Least Operational Overhead: An effective and fully managed method of managing instances.

Well-Architected Framework: Complies with performance, security, and reliability best practices from AWS.

Cons of alternative options:



Option A: The automation and flexibility required for secure administration at scale are not provided by using the EC2 serial terminal directly.

Option C: There is more operational overhead and complexity when a bastion host is deployed.

Option D: For secure instance administration, setting up an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection is too difficult and not the optimal approach.

In conclusion, Option B is suggested as the best option given the given circumstances.

     This solution meets all of the requirements with the LEAST operational overhead. It is repeatable, uses native AWS services, and follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Repeatable: The process of attaching an IAM role to an EC2 instance and using Systems Manager Session Manager to establish a remote SSH session is repeatable. This can be easily automated, so that new instances can be provisioned and administrators can connect to them securely without any manual intervention.

     With AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, you can manage your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs). You can use either an interactive one-click browser-based shell or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). It provides secure and auditable node management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.

     Option A provides direct access to the terminal interface of each instance, but it may not be practical for administration purposes and can be cumbersome to manage, especially for multiple instances.

Option C adds operational overhead and introduces additional infrastructure that needs to be managed, monitored, and secured. It also requires SSH key management and maintenance.

Option D is complex and may not be necessary for remote administration. It also requires administrators to connect from their local on-premises machines, which adds complexity and potential security risks.

Therefore, option B is the recommended solution as it provides secure, auditable, and repeatable remote access using IAM roles and AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, with minimal operational overhead.

On the other side A) come with basically no prerequisites, but it is only for Linux and we do not have info about OSs, so we should assume Windows as well.

     The keyword that makes option B follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework is "IAM role." IAM roles provide fine-grained access control and are a recommended best practice in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. By attaching the appropriate IAM role to each instance and using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish a remote SSH session, the solution is using IAM roles to control access and follows a recommended best practice.

     Option A (replicating the S3 bucket to all AWS Regions) can be costly and complex, requiring replication of data across multiple Regions and managing synchronization. It may not provide a significant latency improvement compared to the CloudFront solution.

Option B (provisioning accelerators in AWS Global Accelerator) can be more expensive as it adds an extra layer of infrastructure (accelerators) and requires associating IP addresses with the S3 bucket. CloudFront already includes global edge locations and provides similar acceleration capabilities.

Option D (enabling S3 Transfer Acceleration) can help improve upload speed to the S3 bucket but may not have a significant impact on reducing latency for website visitors.

Therefore, option C is the most cost-effective solution as it leverages CloudFront's caching and global distribution capabilities to decrease latency and improve website performance.

     Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that distributes content globally to reduce latency. By setting up a CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket hosting the static website, you can take advantage of its edge locations around the world to deliver content from the nearest location to the users, reducing the latency they experience.

CloudFront automatically caches and replicates content to its edge locations, resulting in faster delivery and lower latency for users worldwide. This solution is highly effective in optimizing performance while keeping costs under control because CloudFront charges are based on actual data transfer and requests, and the pay-as-you-go pricing model ensures that you only pay for what you use.

     Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations around the world, providing low latency and high transfer speeds to users accessing the content. Adding a CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket will cache the static website's content at edge locations around the world, decreasing latency for users accessing the website.

This solution is also cost-effective as it only charges for the data transfer and requests made by users accessing the content from the CloudFront edge locations. Additionally, this solution provides scalability and reliability benefits as CloudFront can automatically scale to handle increased demand and provide high availability for the website.

     Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of static and dynamic web content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. It does this by placing cache servers in locations around the world, which store copies of the content and serve it to users from the location that is nearest to them.

     Option B (changing the DB instance to a memory optimized instance class) focuses on improving memory capacity but may not directly address the storage performance issue.

Option C (changing the DB instance to a burstable performance instance class) is suitable for workloads with varying usage patterns and burstable performance needs, but it may not provide consistent and predictable performance for heavy write workloads.

Option D (enabling Multi-AZ RDS read replicas with MySQL native asynchronous replication) is a solution for high availability and read scaling but does not directly address the storage performance issue.

Therefore, option A is the most appropriate solution to address the performance issue by leveraging Provisioned IOPS SSD storage type, which provides consistent and predictable I/O performance for the Amazon RDS for MySQL database.

     A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD.

Here's why:

Provisioned IOPS SSD: This storage type is designed to deliver fast, predictable, and consistent I/O performance, which is crucial for databases with high transaction rates and frequent updates. It allows you to provision a specific level of IOPS to meet the performance requirements of your workload.

Current Issue: The problem with insert operations taking 10 seconds or longer indicates that the current General Purpose SSD storage is not providing sufficient IOPS for the workload. Provisioned IOPS SSD can significantly improve storage performance and reduce latency for database operations.

     A. IOPS is about increasing the number of input connections so you can handle more requests. Which may not be the issue.
B. Having a memory optimized class provides more RAM to execute the queries which take upto 10 secs to complete. More RAM means they can execute faster.
C and D are distractors. They deal with high availability and timely scalability which are not issues here.

     I go with option A. Using Amazon Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD storage is the best way to solve the performance issue of insert operations taking 10 seconds or longer on an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table with more than 10 million rows and 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage.


A high-performance storage solution with reliable throughput and minimal latency is PIOPS SSD storage. Workloads like insert operations, which demand high I/O performance, are ideally suited for it.

     Option A is answer -  A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD. 
The company's issue is related to storage performance, specifically with insert operations. This suggests that the I/O operations are the bottleneck.

Provisioned IOPS SSD storage type is designed to handle the kind of workload the company is experiencing and should help improve the performance of insert operations.

     The best solution would be to change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD. This allows you to specify a higher level of IOPS provisioned for your workload's needs.Therefore, switching to Provisioned IOPS SSD storage is the most direct way to resolve the storage performance bottleneck causing the slow insert times. The ability to provision high IOPS makes it the best solution for high throughput transactional workloads like this one.

     I understand A is the most operationally efficient option of all but I can't wrap my head around the fact that objects must have a minimum of 30 days before they can transition or expire from Amazon S3. This means that for the first 30 days after an item is created, you cannot transition or remove it. So, how option A can be the best fit?

     B suggests launching EC2 instances to ingest and store the alerts, which introduces additional infrastructure management overhead and may not be as cost-effective and scalable as using managed services like Kinesis Data Firehose and S3.

C involves delivering the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster and manually managing snapshots and data deletion. This introduces additional complexity and manual overhead compared to the simpler solution of using Kinesis Data Firehose and S3.

D suggests using SQS to ingest the alerts, but it does not provide the same level of data persistence and durability as storing the alerts directly in S3. Additionally, it requires manual processing and copying of messages to S3, which adds operational complexity.

Therefore, A provides the most operationally efficient solution that meets the company's requirements by leveraging Kinesis Data Firehose to ingest the alerts, storing them in an S3 bucket, and using an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to S3 Glacier for long-term archival, all without the need for managing additional infrastructure.

     It says "LEAST operational overhead" (ie do it in a way it's the less work for me).
If you know a little Amazon AppFlow (see the some videos) you'll see you'll need time to configure and test it, and at the end cope with the errors during the extraction and load the info to the target.
The customer in the example ALREADY has some EC2 that do the work, the only problem is the performance, that WILL be improved scaling out and adding a queue (SNS) to decouple the work of notify the user.
The operational load of doing this is LESS that configuring AppFlow.

       Agreed, I hesitated a long time exactly for this reason. However, the requirement is to improve the performance as much as possible. I cannot guarantee the same performance with EC2 than with managed services. That's why I eventually voted B.

       With AWS, a managed service is "less operational overhead" regardless of the complexity of the setup. AppFlow management is less of a headache when compared to EC2 management so A cannot be correct. EC2 has a setup overhead of OS/Application/Code hooks, security etc. continuous patching/upgrading seems like more than what you'll need to do with SaaS.
B is the correct answer.

     First i thought it would be A but with more stydy found if its Saas and need to choose between EC2 and aws managed service one should always choose AWS managed service. So AppFlow seems more appropriate here.

"With Amazon AppFlow automate bi-directional data flows between SaaS applications and AWS services in just a few clicks."

If you want to pass the exam, choose B, regardless of your personal experience! Always use AWS managed services for "least operational overhead"

     Yea , I think this question is looking for Amazon  Appflow.I also feel like it would be easier to set up Autoscaling for the already  existing EC2 instances in the short term but then the fact that this software integrates with  a lot of SAAS services means using Amazon Appflow will work  reduce operational overhead in the long term

     This is a tough one. If they were not already using EC2 the answer would for sure be AppFlow (B). The question says "least operational overheard" so I feel like it takes more work to configure AppFlow than it does to create auto scaling in EC2. 

If I had this question on the test, I would likely go with AppFlow so B

     While option B utilizes managed services and can be a valid approach, it's important to note that Amazon AppFlow is primarily designed for data integration and synchronization between various SaaS applications and AWS services. It may introduce an additional layer of complexity compared to directly handling the uploads with EC2 instances.

Ultimately, the choice between Option A and Option B depends on specific factors such as the existing architecture, the nature of data transfers, and any potential advantages offered by using Amazon AppFlow for data integration.

If the primary concern is to improve performance for data uploads and user notifications without introducing new services, Option A (Auto Scaling group with S3 event notifications) would likely be the simpler and more operationally efficient choice. However, if data integration between SaaS sources and the S3 bucket is a critical aspect of the application, Option B might be a more suitable approach.

     Deploying a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 is the most cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges. A gateway VPC endpoint is a network gateway that allows communication between instances in a VPC and a service, such as Amazon S3, without requiring an Internet gateway or a NAT device. Data transfer between the VPC and the service through a gateway VPC endpoint is free of charge, while data transfer between the VPC and the Internet through an Internet gateway or NAT device is subject to data transfer charges. By using a gateway VPC endpoint, the company can reduce its data transfer costs by eliminating the need to transfer data through the NAT gateway to access Amazon S3. This option would provide the required connectivity to Amazon S3 and minimize data transfer charges.

     By deploying a gateway VPC endpoint for S3, the company can establish a direct connection between their VPC and S3 without going through the internet gateway or NAT gateway. This enables traffic between the EC2 and S3 to stay within the Amazon network, avoiding Regional data transfer charges.

A suggests launching the NAT gateway in each AZ. While this can help with availability and redundancy, it does not address the issue of data transfer charges, as the traffic would still traverse the NAT gateways and incur data transfer fees.

B suggests replacing the NAT gateway with a NAT instance. However, this solution still involves transferring data between the instances and S3 through the NAT instance, which would result in data transfer charges.

D suggests provisioning an EC2 Dedicated Host to run the EC2. While this can provide dedicated hardware for the instances, it does not directly address the issue of data transfer charges.

     'Regional' data transfer isn't clear but I think we have to assume this means the traffic stays in the region.
The two options that seem possible are NAT gateway per AZ vs privatelink gateway endpoints per AZ.
privatelink/endpoints do have costs (url below)
privatelink endpoint / LB costs look lower than NAT gateway costs
privatelink doesn't incur inter-AZ data transfer charges (if in the same region) as NAT gateways do which goes towards the key requirement stated

     Option B (correct). Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.

AWS Direct Connect is a network service that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public Internet and can provide more reliable, lower-latency communication between your on-premises application and Amazon S3. By directing backup traffic through the AWS Direct Connect connection, you can minimize the impact on your internet bandwidth and ensure timely backups to S3.

       Option A (wrong), establishing AWS VPN connections and proxying all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint, would not necessarily minimize the impact on internet bandwidth as it would still utilize the public Internet to access S3. 

Option C (wrong), using AWS Snowball devices, would not address the issue of internet bandwidth limitations as the data would still need to be transferred over the Internet to and from the Snowball devices. 

Option D (wrong), submitting a support ticket to request the removal of S3 service limits, would not address the issue of internet bandwidth limitations and would not ensure timely backups to S3.

         Option C is wrong so is your reason. you do not need internet to load data into Snowball Devices. if you are using snow cone for example, u will connect it to your on-premises device directly for loading and Aws will load it in the cloud. However, it not effective to do that everyday , hence option B is the better choice.

     I picked option B, because AWS Direct Connect offers a dedicated, secure, high-performance connection that may circumvent bandwidth restrictions and minimize the impact on internet access, AWS Direct Connect is the ideal choice for backing up data to Amazon S3. Some solutions are not as good because they are not as scalable, reliable, or secure as VPN connections, Snowball devices, or reducing S3 service constraints.

     Right option is C,, In AWS Direct Connect, the network is not fluctuating and provides a consistent experience, while in AWS VPN the VPN is connected with shared and public networks, so the bandwidth and latency fluctuate. Hence direct connect is better choice than virtual connect.

     AWS Direct Connect cloud service is the shortest path to your AWS resources. While in transit, your network traffic remains on the AWS global network and never touches the public internet. This reduces the chance of hitting bottlenecks or unexpected increases in latency.

     AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection between on-premises and AWS, bypassing public internet. By establishing this connection for backup traffic, company can ensure fast and reliable transfers between their on-premises and S3 without impacting their internet connectivity for internal users. This provides a dedicated and high-speed connection that is well-suited for data transfers and minimizes impact on internet bandwidth limitations.

While option A  can provide a secure connection, it still utilizes internet bandwidth for data transfer and may not effectively address issue of limited bandwidth.

While option C can work for occasional large data transfers, it may not be suitable for frequent backups and can introduce additional operational overhead.

D, submitting a support ticket to request removal of S3 service limits, does not address issue of internet bandwidth limitations and is not a relevant solution for given requirements.

     The correct solution is AB, as you can see here:

https://aws.amazon.com/it/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-audit-deleted-missing-objects/

It states the following:

To prevent or mitigate future accidental deletions, consider the following features:

Enable versioning to keep historical versions of an object.
Enable Cross-Region Replication of objects.
Enable MFA delete to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) when deleting an object version.

       but it could be C you could use 's3:deleteobject" permission without specific conditions or restricts only to authorized users. B does the same thing tho but B is mainly used to restrict unauthroized access not deletion. does anyone agree. I think it is A and C or A &amp; B

     Enabling versioning on S3 ensures multiple versions of object are stored in bucket. When object is updated or deleted, new version is created, preserving previous version.

Enabling MFA Delete adds additional layer of protection by requiring MFA device to be present when attempting to delete objects. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions by requiring extra level of authentication.

C. Creating a bucket policy on S3 is more focused on defining access control and permissions for bucket and its objects, rather than protecting against accidental deletion.

D. Enabling default encryption on S3 ensures that any new objects uploaded to bucket are automatically encrypted. While encryption is important for data security, it does not directly address accidental deletion.

E. Creating lifecycle policy for objects in S3 allows for automated management of objects based on predefined rules. While this can help with data retention and storage cost optimization, it does not directly protect against accidental deletion.

     To protect critical data in an Amazon S3 bucket from accidental deletion, a solutions architect should take the following steps:

Enable versioning on the S3 bucket: This allows you to recover objects that are accidentally deleted or overwritten by keeping multiple versions of an object.

Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket: This adds an extra layer of security by requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for delete operations, which helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions

     Ans A,B - as per  'kwabsAA' 2 months ago
"To protect data from accidental deletion, the correct answers are B and D. Versioning does not prevent accidental deletion; it only allows for recovery after the fact. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) helps prevent accidental deletion by requiring an additional confirmation step before deletion, making it deliberate rather than accidental. Option D, which involves encryption, ensures that only individuals with the encryption keys can read or manipulate the data, thus preventing unauthorized access and manipulation, including deletion."

     Not sure why Answer is BD. I am trying to rationalize it. What I guess could be to address keyword "critical data" where set default encryption is just enhance the security of stored data but does not prevent from deletion. This will be have 2 options A, B for that. B is make sense to ensure user know what to delete on second layer. For option A, it just help you to audit and recovered what was accidentally deleted but does not "prevent" accidentally delete.

     Yeah so.. encryption is enabled by default on S3, sooooo why is the answer D.

---------

Starting today, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) encrypts all new objects by default. Now, S3 automatically applies server-side encryption (SSE-S3) for each new object, unless you specify a different encryption option.

     Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic: This will decouple the data ingestion process and ensure that messages are not lost if the Lambda function fails to process them immediately

Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue: This ensures that the Lambda function can process the messages from the SQS queue, providing a reliable way to handle data ingestion even if there are network issues.

     BE is correct as SQS ensures the messages are stored in a queue for processing.
A: No issue with Lambda availability so this solution is wrong
C: No issues with CPU or memory so no value added by this step also
D: This is not a provisioning issue so provisioning more Lambda won't solve the re-execution issues. The missed messages will still be lost

     Since network timeout is the issue here, introduce SQS and read from it , that way when network goes down, data still remains in the queue and when connectivity is back, the lambda function can continue from the last data in the queue

     A. Deploying the Lambda function in multiple Availability Zones improves availability and fault tolerance but does not guarantee ingestion of all data.

C. Increasing CPU and memory allocated to the Lambda function may improve its performance but does not address the issue of connectivity failures.

D. Increasing provisioned throughput for the Lambda function is not applicable as Lambda functions are automatically scaled by AWS and provisioned throughput is not configurable.

Therefore, the correct combination of actions to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future is to create an SQS queue and subscribe it to the SNS topic (option B) and modify the Lambda function to read from the SQS queue (option E).

     This is poorly worded - why does option D have "meats" in it?! Amazon Macie cannot handle files larger than 8GB, so it has to be option D.

       This quota applies only to the Amazon Macie console and the Amazon Macie API. There isn't a quota for the number of finding events that Macie publishes to Amazon EventBridge or the number of sensitive data discovery results that Macie creates for each run of a job.

     It's B. This is the trickiest question I've seen so far. Here, you _must_ know precisely what these tools do because context clues won't help you. You *have* to read the question carefully; poor reading comprehension will hurt you. If you're successful at both, the answer is obvious. You need to remedy or fix the problem automatically and simply notify an admin. Macie and (Amazon SNS). The answer is B.

     Please note that the question requires a solution that "AUTOMATES REMEDIATION"
B states: "trigger a notification to the ADMINISTRATORS TO REMOVE the objects that contain PII" 
This goes against the "AUTOMATE" requirement

     I'm going to with D. A is not the answer because Amazon Inspector does not detect PII. B could be except for the "automate remediation". C does not automate remediation. Even with the extra development effort, D is the answer that suits better the question.

     Always prefer AWS manages solution, especially when they have a SaaS over custom solution when the ask for "with the LEAST development effort". Anything else doesn't really matter.
B is the only choice as Macie is PII detection and SNS is for alerting.

     I am in the consideration B and D. Based on the requirement, it need to detect and notify administrator when PII data uploaded. And with LEAST development effort - option B definite an answer. However, it does not meet the automate remediation which need some extra configuration. I opt for D for the reason meeting 3 points, but development (on coding) could be extra/ also subject to the skillset and experience.

Any thought?

     ***CORRECT***
Option D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

An On-Demand Capacity Reservation is a type of Amazon EC2 reservation that enables you to create and manage reserved capacity on Amazon EC2. With an On-Demand Capacity Reservation, you can specify the Region and Availability Zones where you want to reserve capacity, and the number of EC2 instances you want to reserve. This allows you to guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones in a specific Region.

***WRONG***
Option A, purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed, would not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones. 
Option B, creating an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed, would not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones. 
Option C, purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed, would not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones as Reserved Instances do not provide capacity reservations.

       Just to avoid any confusion, Reserved Instance also guarantee capacity reservation. However, the reason why we don't need Reserved Instances is because they are reserved for a duration of 1 to 3 years with a lock-in contract (no refunds!). The company is only interested in reserved capacity for a week so D is the best solution.

     The most appropriate option to guarantee EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones in the desired AWS Region for the 1-week event is to create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones (option D).

A. Purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed does not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones.

B. Creating an On-Demand Capacity Reservation without specifying the Availability Zones would not guarantee capacity in the desired zones.

C. Purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones is not necessary for a short-term event and involves longer-term commitments.

     I agree that the answer is D because its only needed for a 1 week event. C would be right if it was a re-occurring event for 1 or more years as reserved instances have to be purchased on long term commitments but would satisfy the capacity requirements.

     D. Reservations are used for long term. A minimum of 1 - 3 years making it cheaper. Whereas, on demand reservation is where you will always get access to CAPACITY it either be 1 week in advance or 1 month in an AZ but you pay On-Demand price meaning there is no discount.

     Option C, which suggests moving the catalog to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, is not a suitable choice for an active catalog that requires high availability and quick access. Glacier Deep Archive is designed for long-term archival and may not provide the low-latency access required for a catalog used in a website.

Therefore, option D is the most appropriate choice for achieving both high availability and durability for the catalog.

     I think the answer is B:
Users access the files randomly

S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. You can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering as the default storage class for virtually any workload, especially data lakes, data analytics, new applications, and user-generated content.

       It says "S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns".
However, the statement says access pattern is predictable. It says there is frequent access about 1year.

       Agree, S3 Intelligent-Tiering meets all the requirements. The very important/crucial consideration here to satisfy that all files withing a year are instantly accessible is that the two options "Archive Access" and "Deep Archive Access" are not enabled in the "Archive rule actions" section present in the "Intelligent-Tiering Archive configurations" of the bucket. Those options are not enabled by default so this answer will work.

       Answer is C, why not intelligent Tiering
 
If the Intelligent-Tiering data transitions to Glacier after 180 days instead of 1 year, it would still be a cost-effective solution that meets the requirements.

With files stored in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering, the data is automatically moved to the appropriate storage class based on its access patterns. In this case, if the data transitions to Glacier after 180 days, it means that files that are infrequently accessed beyond the initial 180 days will be stored in Glacier, which is a lower-cost storage option compared to S3 Standard.

         The Answer is B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering stores objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access. For a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. There are no retrieval fees in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed later, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier. No additional tiering fees apply when objects are moved between access tiers within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is designed for 99.9% availability and 99.999999999% durability, and offers the same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard

         With S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you can define rules that determine when objects should be moved from the frequent access tier to the infrequent access tier, or vice versa, within S3 Standard storage classes.

     Answer is C. The only difference between choice B and C is Glacier Storage class. The question states clearly that "giving users the ability to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year-old as quickly as possible". This is possible via instant retrieval and not flexible retrieval.

     The answer is C

S3 standard for first part  (intelligent tiering is much better and cost-effective)
glacier instant retrieval because of the statement after an year needs to retrieved as soon as possible) 

Also why ruling out B is because of Athena - it becomes expensive if data is retrieved using it after scanning all the data in glacier per request.

     A: It does not account for random pattern of first year
C: "Store search metadata for each archive in Amazon S3 Standard storage"... this part is wrong for me. Storing metadata forever in S3 so that it can be queries? This is why I won't select it.
D: RDS is costly for storage and query just to know where your S3 object is.
B is correct as Intelligent Tiering takes care of random frequency in first year in most cost effective way. Older object will end up in S3 glacier with flexible retrieval so cost effective. Athena doesn't care where your object is (s3 standard, IA or Glacier) and queries work.

     According to the fact that S3 Std, Std-IA and One Zone-IA are Higher cost, frequent access storage classes and the fact that S3 Intelligent-Tiering is an additional storage class that provides flexibility for data with unknown or changing access patterns. It automates the movement of your objects between storage classes to optimize cost. Plus the requirement for MOST cost-effective solution, Answer B seems to be the right solution

     I picked "B" first, then switched to "C" because it asks for MORE cost-effective = Athena might be pricey: however: 
Access Patterns:
If your data access patterns are predictable and consistent, and you do not require automatic tiering based on access frequency, S3 Standard might be a straightforward and cost-effective choice.
Variable Access Patterns:
If your data access patterns are variable or unpredictable, and you want automatic cost optimization based on access frequency, S3 Intelligent-Tiering might provide cost savings.

     The primary focus of Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, is on installing operating systems security-related updates on managed nodes. By default, Patch Manager doesn't install all available patches, but rather a smaller set of patches focused on security. (Ref https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-how-it-works-selection.html)

Run Command allows you to automate common administrative tasks and perform one-time configuration changes at scale.  (Ref https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/execute-remote-commands.html) 

Seems like patch manager is meant for OS level patches and not 3rd party applications. And this falls under run command wheelhouse to carry out one-time configuration changes (update of 3rd part application) at scale.

       3rd party applications are also supported by Patch Manager (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager.html).
You can use Patch Manager to apply patches for both operating systems and applications. (On Windows Server, application support is limited to updates for applications released by Microsoft.) You can use Patch Manager to install Service Packs on Windows nodes and perform minor version upgrades on Linux nodes. You can patch fleets of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs) by operating system type. This includes supported versions of several operating systems, as listed in Patch Manager prerequisites.

AWS Systems Manager Run Command allows the company to run commands or scripts on multiple EC2 instances. By using Run Command, the company can quickly and easily apply the patch to all 1,000 EC2 instances to remediate the security vulnerability.

Creating an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Lambda functions are not designed to run on EC2 instances. Configuring AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Patch Manager is not designed to apply third-party software patches. Scheduling an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as maintenance windows are not designed to apply patches to third-party software

     In your case, since the company needs to fix a critical security vulnerability as quickly as possible, Patch Manager (option B) would be the most recommended choice. It provides a quick and efficient way to apply the patch to all affected instances without the need to create custom scripts.

However, if your company has specific requirements that cannot be met by Patch Manager, Run Command (option D) may be a viable alternative.

     I originally thought B but after a bit of reading I've changed my mind to D purely because patch manager will not be aware of this random third party application.
Run command allows you to install applications, run powershell, bash etc commands at scale so the most sensible answer would be run command.

         When you send an email with Amazon SES, the email information you need to provide depends on how you call Amazon SES. You can provide a minimal amount of information and have Amazon SES take care of all of the formatting for you. Or, if you want to do something more advanced like send an attachment, you can provide the raw message yourself. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-concepts-email-format.html

     B&amp;D are the only 2 correct options. If you are choosing option E then you missed the daily morning schedule requirement mentioned in the question which cant be achieved with S3 events for SNS. Event Bridge can used to configure scheduled events (every morning in this case). Option B fulfills the email in HTML format requirement (by SES) and D fulfills every morning schedule event requirement (by EventBridge)

       I don't believe you are correct when you say that E cannot meet the scheduling requirement.  If the glue action is scheduled and outputs to S3, then as the S3 event destination is SNS, in effect you have a way of getting SNS to have a scheduled release.

       the daily schedule can be achieve with event bridge
 - schedule and event bridge to trigger daily
 - the event briodge will trigger a lambda function that will collect data and save it in s3
 - once data in s3 the event noitification will trigger SNS to send emails

     D Explanation: EventBridge can be used to schedule regular invocations of a Lambda function that retrieves the required data from the application's API. This step sets up the process to collect the data at the specified time every morning.

B Explanation: Amazon SES can format the data into an easy-to-read HTML report and send the email to multiple recipients efficiently.

     Defo B and D
Look at the aws notes on Sns
Notes
You can't customize the body of the email message. The email delivery feature is intended to provide internal system alerts, not marketing messages.

It can't send anything but notifications. SES can send normal emails therefore, BD is the answer.

     Option B suggests using Amazon SES, which allows you to format the data and email the report to multiple recipients in an efficient and scalable way.

Option E proposes storing application data in Amazon S3, which is scalable and durable storage. By configuring an Amazon SNS topic as an S3 event destination, you can automatically trigger the report to be sent via email whenever new data is added to S3.

     Chat GPT says :
With Amazon SES, you can send rich, formatted email content, including text, HTML, attachments, and embedded images, suitable for email communication.
Amazon SNS is primarily used for sending plain-text or JSON-formatted messages, suitable for notifications and alerts across different channels.

This can suggest that we need to use SES if we want to use HTML content.

     Answer: B and D
Other options
A. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose: This service is typically used for real-time streaming data processing rather than for scheduled tasks like generating a morning report.

C. Amazon EventBridge to invoke an AWS Glue job: AWS Glue is a data integration service that's more focused on ETL (extract, transform, load) operations, often involving large datasets and complex transformations, which might be more than needed for this scenario.

E. Amazon S3 with SNS topic: Storing data in S3 and using SNS for notification is viable, but this doesn't directly address the need to format the data into HTML and send it as an email report. SNS is better suited for sending notifications rather than formatted reports.

     Very detailed question so let's break it down:
"send the report to several email addresses at the same time every morning" this locks B as nothing else can do it.
A: Firehose to collect data from API will work but it cannot generate a report
C: Glue is ETL, it cannot extract data from an API
E: Store data in S3. No idea what this will help with

The API provides order shipping data so you can query it. Lambda can be used to query the API easily so D is good choice that works with B.

BD is correct combination

     "At the same time every morning" requires scheduling, which is only mentioned in C and D. AWS Glue has no native functionality to query REST APIs, thus we need a Lambda function -&gt; D.

For email we need SES or SNS, but as we want "an easy-to-read HTML format", SNS is out. SNS can send notifications, not formatted emails. Thus B.

     C : EFS as It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files.

Multiple compute instances, including Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda,
can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, providing a common data source

     Technically the A could work, ECS is often recommended by AWS in case of minimum operational overhead, and S3 is durable and highly scalable BUT it is not a "traditional" file system structure. In an S3 bucket, there is no real file structure, only files and prefixes that simulate a structure.

B is wrong because of EKS which require more management

EFS is recommended for minimum operational overhead instead of EBS.

So C (EC2 + EFS) is recommended here over D (EC2 + EBS).

     EFS provides a scalable and fully managed file system that can be easily mounted to multiple EC2. It allows you to store and access files using the standard file system structure, which aligns with the company's requirement for a standard file system. EFS automatically scales with the size of your data.

A suggests using ECS for container orchestration and S3 for storage. ECS doesn't offer a native file system storage solution. S3 is an object storage service and may not be the most suitable option for a standard file system structure.

B suggests using EKS for container orchestration and EBS for storage. Similar to A, EBS is block storage and not optimized for file system access. While EKS can manage containers, it doesn't specifically address the file storage requirements.

D suggests using EC2 with EBS for storage. While EBS can provide block storage for EC2, it doesn't inherently offer a scalable file system solution like EFS. You would need to manage and provision EBS volumes manually, which may introduce operational overhead.

     Only CD provides Object Lock options which is required for stopping admin/root users from deleting.
D is governance mode which is like government, pay enough money and you can do anything. This is not what we want so compliance is the option.
C is right choice.

     The key reasons are:

The S3 Lifecycle policy transitions the data to Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year for long-term archival.
S3 Object Lock in compliance mode prevents any user from deleting or overwriting objects for the specified retention period.
Glacier Deep Archive provides very high durability and the lowest storage cost for long-term archival.
Compliance mode ensures no one can override or change the retention settings even if policies change.
This meets all the requirements - immediate access for 1 year, archived for 9 years, unable to delete for 10 years, maximum resiliency

     To meet the requirements of immediately accessible records for 1 year and then archived for an additional 9 years with maximum resiliency, we can use S3 Lifecycle policy to transition records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. And to ensure that the records cannot be deleted by anyone, including administrative and root users, we can use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode for a period of 10 years. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

     To prevent deletion of records during the entire 10-year period, you can utilize S3 Object Lock feature. By enabling it in compliance mode, you can set a retention period on the objects, preventing any user, including administrative and root users, from deleting records.

A: S3 Glacier is suitable for long-term archival, it may not provide immediate accessibility for the first year as required.

B: Intelligent-Tiering may not offer the most cost-effective archival storage option for extended 9-year period. Changing the IAM policy after 10 years to allow deletion also introduces manual steps and potential human error.

D: While S3 One Zone-IA can provide cost savings, it doesn't offer the same level of resiliency as S3 Glacier Deep Archive for long-term archival.

     Retention Period: A period is specified by Days &amp; Years.
With Retention Compliance Mode, you can't change/adjust (even by the account root user) the retention mode during the retention period while all objects within the bucket are Locked.
With Retention Governance mode, a less restrictive mode, you can grant special permission to a group of users to adjust the Lock settings by using S3:BypassGovernanceRetention.

Legal Hold: It's On/Off setting on an object version. There is no retention period. If you enable Legal Hole on specific object version, you will not be able to delete or override that specific object version. It needs S:PutObjectLegalHole as a permission.

To meet the requirements, the company could use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon's lowest-cost storage class, specifically designed for long-term retention of data that is accessed rarely. This would allow the company to store the records with maximum resiliency and at the lowest possible cost.

       To ensure that the records are not deleted during the entire 10-year period, the company could use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode. S3 Object Lock allows the company to apply a retention period to objects in S3, preventing the objects from being deleted until the retention period expires. By using S3 Object Lock in compliance mode, the company can ensure that the records are not deleted by anyone, including administrative users and root users, during the entire 10-year period.

     A and B are ruled out as you need them to be accessible for 1 year and using control policy or IAM policies, the administrator or root still has the ability to delete them.
D is ruled out as it uses One Zone-IA, but requirement says max- resiliency. 
SO- C should be the right answer.

     The key reasons are:

FSx for Windows provides fully managed Windows-native SMB file shares that are accessible from Windows clients.
It allows seamlessly migrating the existing Windows file shares to FSx shares without disrupting users.
The Multi-AZ configuration provides high availability and durability for file storage.
Users can continue to access files the same way over SMB without any changes.
It is optimized for Windows workloads and provides features like user quotas, ACLs, AD integration.
Data is stored on SSDs with automatic backups for resilience.

     Migrating all the data to FSx for Windows File Server allows you to preserve existing user access method and maintain compatibility with Windows file shares. Users can continue accessing files using the same method as before, without any disruptions.

A: S3 is a highly durable object storage service, it is not designed to directly host Windows file shares. Implementing IAM authentication for file access would require significant changes to existing user access method.

B: S3 File Gateway can provide access to Amazon S3 objects through standard file protocols, it may not be ideal solution for preserving existing user access method and maintaining Windows file shares.

D: Although Amazon EFS provides highly available and durable file storage, it may not directly support the existing Windows file shares and their access method.

C: SG to allow input to private subnet means everything else will be blocked. Attaching this SG to DB instance means it will block everything except the private subnet instances which  is where the required EC2 instances are.

     RDS databases can only be accessed by EC2 instances located in private subnets: From the security group given to instances in the private subnets, the DB instances' security group will permit incoming traffic. Because of this, the RDS databases will only be accessible by EC2 instances located on the private subnets.
Because of its safe architecture, Every other source of incoming traffic will be blocked by the security group that is linked to the database instances. The RDS databases will be better shielded from unwanted access thanks to this.

     The key reasons are:

Using security groups to control access between resources is a standard practice in VPCs.
The security group attached to the RDS DB instances can allow inbound traffic from the security group for the EC2 instances in the private subnets.
This allows only those EC2 instances in the private subnets to connect to the databases, meeting the requirements.
Route tables, peering connections, and denying public subnet access would not achieve the needed selectivity of allowing only the private subnet EC2 instances.
Security groups provide stateful filtering at the instance level for precise access control.

     Creating security group that allows inbound traffic from security group assigned to instances in private subnets ensures that only EC2 running in private subnets can access the RDS databases. By associating security group with DB, you restrict access to only instances that belong to designated security group.

A: This approach may help control routing within VPC, it does not address the specific access requirement between EC2 instances and RDS databases.

B: Using a deny rule in a security group can lead to complexities and potential misconfigurations. It is generally recommended to use allow rules to explicitly define access permissions.

D: Peering connections enable communication between different VPCs or VPCs in different regions, and they are not necessary for restricting access between subnets within the same VPC.

     Create a security group that allows inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances in the private subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances. This will allow the EC2 instances in the private subnets to have access to the RDS databases while denying access to the EC2 instances in the public subnets.

     The solution that meets the requirements described in the question is option C: Create a security group that allows inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances in the private subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.

In this solution, the security group applied to the DB instances allows inbound traffic from the security group assigned to instances in the private subnets. This ensures that only EC2 instances running in the private subnets can have access to the RDS databases.

       Option A, creating a new route table that excludes the route to the public subnets' CIDR blocks and associating it with the database subnets, would not meet the requirements because it would block all traffic to the database subnets, not just traffic from the public subnets.

Option B, creating a security group that denies inbound traffic from the security group assigned to instances in the public subnets and attaching it to the DB instances, would not meet the requirements because it would allow all traffic from the private subnets to reach the DB instances, not just traffic from the security group assigned to instances in the private subnets.

Option D, creating a new peering connection between the public subnets and the private subnets and a different peering connection between the private subnets and the database subnets, would not meet the requirements because it would allow all traffic from the private subnets to reach the DB instances, not just traffic from the security group assigned to instances in the private subnets.

     The correct solution to meet these requirements is option C.

To design the API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate, the company needs to do the following:

1. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to create an endpoint that is specific to a region.

2. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name: This will allow the company to use its own domain name for the API Gateway URL.

3. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region: This will allow the company to use HTTPS for secure communication with its APIs.

4. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use the certificate for securing the API Gateway URL.

5. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway URL using the company's domain name.

       Option C includes all the necessary steps to meet the requirements, hence it is the correct solution. 

Options A and D do not include the necessary steps to associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name and attach the certificate to the endpoint. 

Option B includes the necessary steps to associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name and attach the certificate, but it imports the certificate into the us-east-1 Region instead of the ca-central-1 Region where the API Gateway is located.

     All certificates in ACM are regional resources, including the certificates that you import. To use the same certificate with Elastic Load Balancing load balancers in different AWS Regions, you must import the certificate into each Region where you want to use it. To use a certificate with Amazon CloudFront, you must import it into the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

     c is right 
The other options have various issues:

Option A: Using stage variables and importing certificates into ACM is not sufficient for achieving the requirement of associating a custom domain and certificate with the API Gateway endpoint.

Option B: While it mentions importing the certificate into ACM, it doesn't address the need for a Regional API Gateway or the appropriate region for the certificate.

Option D: Using certificates from the us-east-1 region for a Regional API Gateway might cause issues. Additionally, it doesn't provide clear details on how to associate the domain name and certificate with the API Gateway endpoint.

     C is the correct solution.

To use a custom domain name with HTTPS for API Gateway:

The API Gateway endpoint needs to be Regional, not private or edge-optimized.
The ACM certificate must be requested in the same region as the API Gateway endpoint.
The custom domain name is then mapped to the Regional API endpoint under API Gateway domain names.
Route 53 is configured to route traffic to the API Gateway regional domain.
The ACM certificate is attached to the API Gateway domain name to enable HTTP

     The best solution to meet these requirements would be option B: Use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content, and use human review for low-confidence predictions.

Amazon Rekognition is a cloud-based image and video analysis service that can detect inappropriate content in images using its pre-trained label detection model. It can identify a wide range of inappropriate content, including explicit or suggestive adult content, violent content, and offensive language. The service provides high accuracy and low latency, making it a good choice for this use case.

       Option A, using Amazon Comprehend, is not a good fit for this use case because Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing service that is designed to analyze text, not images.

Option C, using Amazon SageMaker to detect inappropriate content, would require significant development effort to build and train a custom machine learning model. It would also require a large dataset of labeled images to train the model, which may be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.

Option D, using AWS Fargate to deploy a custom machine learning model, would also require significant development effort and a large dataset of labeled images. It may not be the most efficient or cost-effective solution for this use case.

In summary, the best solution is to use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content in images, and use human review for low-confidence predictions to ensure that all inappropriate content is detected.

     Using Amazon Rekognition for content moderation is a cost-effective and efficient solution that reduces the need for developing and training custom machine learning models, making it the best option in terms of minimizing development effort.

A. Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing service provided by AWS, primarily focused on text analysis rather than image analysis.

C. Amazon SageMaker is a comprehensive machine learning service that allows you to build, train, and deploy custom machine learning models. It requires significant development effort to build and train a custom model. In addition, utilizing ground truth to label low-confidence predictions would further add to the development complexity and maintenance overhead.

D. Similar to C, using AWS Fargate to deploy a custom machine learning model requires significant development effort.

     Good answer is C:
AWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without having to manage servers. AWS Fargate is compatible with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

     Using ECS on Fargate allows you to run containers without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Fargate abstracts away the underlying EC2 and provides serverless compute for containers.

A. This option would require manual provisioning and management of EC2, as well as installing and configuring Docker on those instances. It would introduce additional overhead and responsibilities for maintaining the underlying infrastructure.

B. While this option leverages ECS to manage containers, it still requires provisioning and managing EC2 to serve as worker nodes. It adds complexity and maintenance overhead compared to the serverless nature of Fargate.

D. This option still involves managing and provisioning EC2, even though an ECS-optimized AMI simplifies the process of setting up EC2 for running ECS. It does not provide the level of serverless abstraction and ease of management offered by Fargate.

     In order to execute containerized apps without having to manage servers, AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for Amazon ECS. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance clusters no longer require provisioning, configuring, or scaling thanks to AWS Fargate. So that you can concentrate on developing and maintaining your applications, AWS Fargate handles the monotonous, repetitive labor of managing servers.

AWS Fargate is a fully managed container execution environment that runs containers without the need to provision and manage underlying infrastructure. This makes it a good choice for companies that want to focus on maintaining their critical applications and do not want to be responsible for provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure.

Option A involves installing Docker on Amazon EC2 instances, which would still require the company to manage the underlying infrastructure.

     Option D is the most appropriate solution for transmitting and processing the clickstream data in this scenario.

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a highly scalable and durable service that enables real-time processing of streaming data at a high volume and high rate. You can use Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process the clickstream data in real-time.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that loads streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. You can use Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the data from Kinesis Data Streams to an Amazon S3 data lake.

Once the data is in the data lake, you can use Amazon Redshift to load the data and perform analysis on it. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that allows you to quickly and efficiently analyze data using SQL and your existing business intelligence tools.

       Option A, which involves using AWS Data Pipeline to archive the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and running an Amazon EMR cluster with the data to generate analytics, is not the most appropriate solution because it does not involve real-time processing of the data.

Option B, which involves creating an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to process the data and sending it to an Amazon S3 data lake for Amazon Redshift to use for analysis, is not the most appropriate solution because it does not involve a fully managed service for transmitting the data from the processing layer to the data lake.

Option C, which involves caching the data to Amazon CloudFront, storing the data in an Amazon S3 bucket, and running an AWS Lambda function to process the data for analysis when an object is added to the S3 bucket, is not the most appropriate solution because it does not involve a scalable and durable service for collecting and processing the data in real-time.

       Unsure if this is right URL for this scenario. Option D is referring to S3 and then Redshift. Whereas URL discuss about eliminating S3   :-   We're excited to launch Amazon Redshift streaming ingestion for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, which enables you to ingest data directly from the Kinesis data stream without having to stage the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Streaming ingestion allows you to achieve low latency in the order of seconds while ingesting hundreds of megabytes of data into your Amazon Redshift cluster.

     The answer should be A. Clickstream does not mean real time, it just means they capture user interactions on the web page. Kinesis data streaming is not required. Furthermore, redshift is a data warehousing solution, it cant run complex analysis as well as EMR. My vote goes for A

     The key reasons are:

Kinesis Data Streams can continuously capture and ingest high volumes of clickstream data in real-time. This handles the large 30TB daily data intake.
Kinesis Firehose can automatically load the streaming data into S3. This creates a data lake for further analysis.
Firehose can transform and analyze the data in flight before loading to S3 using Lambda. This enables real-time processing.
The data in S3 can be easily loaded into Amazon Redshift for interactive analysis at scale.
Kinesis auto scales to handle the high data volumes. Minimal effort is needed for infrastructure management.

     A. This option utilizes S3 for data storage and EMR for analytics, Data Pipeline is not ideal service for real-time streaming data ingestion and processing. It is better suited for batch processing scenarios.

B. This option involves managing and scaling EC2, which adds operational overhead. It is also not real-time streaming solution. Additionally, use of Redshift for analyzing clickstream data might not be most efficient or cost-effective approach.

C. CloudFront is CDN service and is not designed for real-time data processing or analytics. While using Lambda to process data can be an option, it may not be most efficient solution for processing large volumes of clickstream data.

Therefore, collecting the data from Kinesis Data Streams, using Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit it to S3 data lake, and loading it into Redshift for analysis is the recommended approach. This combination provides scalable, real-time streaming solution with storage and analytics capabilities that can handle high volume of clickstream data.

     I am going to be unpopular here and I'll go for A). Even if here are other services that offer a better experience, data Pipeline can do the job here. "you can use AWS Data Pipeline to archive your web server's logs to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) each day and then run a weekly Amazon EMR (Amazon EMR) cluster over those logs to generate traffic reports" https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/what-is-datapipeline.html In the question there is no specific timing requirement for analytics. Also the EMR cluster job can be scheduled be executed daily.

Option D) is a valid answer too, however with Amazon Redshift Streaming Ingestion "you can connect to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams data streams and pull data directly to Amazon Redshift without staging data in S3" https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/redshift-streaming-ingestion. So in this scenario Kinesis Data Firehose and S3 are redundant.

       I think I agree with you, I does not make sense in option D) using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the data to an Amazon S3 data lake and then to Redshift, as you can send directly the data from Firehose to Redshift.

     It is C.
The image in here https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/ shows how kinesis can send data collected to firehose who can send it to Redshift. 
It is also possible to use an intermediary S3 bucket between firehose and redshift. See image in here

     C. Create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

To meet the requirement of forwarding all requests to the website so that the requests will use HTTPS, a solutions architect can create a listener rule on the ALB that redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS. This can be done by creating a rule with a condition that matches all HTTP traffic and a rule action that redirects the traffic to the HTTPS listener. The HTTPS listener should already be configured to accept HTTPS traffic and forward it to the target group.

       Option A. Updating the ALB's network ACL to accept only HTTPS traffic is not a valid solution because the network ACL is used to control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level, not at the listener level.

Option B. Creating a rule that replaces the HTTP in the URL with HTTPS is not a valid solution because this would not redirect the traffic to the HTTPS listener.

Option D. Replacing the ALB with a Network Load Balancer configured to use Server Name Indication (SNI) is not a valid solution because it would not address the requirement to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

     A. Network ACLs operate at subnet level and control inbound and outbound traffic. Updating the network ACL alone will not enforce the redirection of HTTP to HTTPS.

B. This approach would require modifying application code or server configuration to perform URL rewrite. It is not an optimal solution as it adds complexity and potential maintenance overhead. Moreover, it does not leverage the ALB's capabilities for handling HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection.

D. While NLB can handle SSL/TLS termination using SNI for routing requests to different services, replacing the ALB solely to enforce HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection would be an unnecessary and more complex solution.

Therefore, the recommended approach is to create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. By configuring a listener rule, you can define a redirect action that automatically directs HTTP requests to their corresponding HTTPS versions.

Steps 6-8 tells exactly how to do this:
"6. Select a load balancer, and then choose HTTP Listener.
7. Under Rules, choose View/edit rules.
8. Choose Edit Rule to modify the existing default rule to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS. Or, insert a rule between the existing rules (if appropriate for your use case)."

     This solution meets all of the requirements:

Forward all requests to the website so that the requests will use HTTPS: The ALB can be configured to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
The other options are not as good for this scenario:

A. Updating the ALB's network ACL to accept only HTTPS traffic will prevent users from accessing the website using HTTP.
B. Creating a rule that replaces the HTTP in the URL with HTTPS will not prevent users from accessing the website using HTTP.
D. Replacing the ALB with a Network Load Balancer configured to use Server Name Indication (SNI) is not necessary because the ALB can be configured to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

     The best solution is to create a listener rule on the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS (option C).

Here is why:

ALB listener rules allow you to redirect traffic from one listener port (e.g. 80 for HTTP) to another (e.g. 443 for HTTPS). This achieves the goal to forward all requests over HTTPS.
Network ACLs control traffic at the subnet level and cannot distinguish between HTTP and HTTPS requests to implement a redirect (option A incorrect).
Replacing HTTP with HTTPS in the URL happens at the client side. It does not redirect at the ALB (option B incorrect).
Network Load Balancers work at the TCP level and do not understand HTTP or HTTPS protocols. So they cannot redirect in this manner (option D incorrect).

     This rule can be created in the following way:
1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Load Balancers.
3. Select the ALB and choose Listeners.
4. Choose View/edit rules and then choose Add rule.
5. In the Add Rule dialog box, choose HTTPS.
6. In the Default action dialog box, choose Redirect to HTTPS.
7. Choose Save rules.
This listener rule will redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS, ensuring that all traffic is encrypted.

     Configure an HTTPS listener on the ALB: This step involves setting up an HTTPS listener on the ALB and configuring the security policy to use a secure SSL/TLS protocol and cipher suite.

Create a redirect rule on the ALB: The redirect rule should be configured to redirect all incoming HTTP requests to HTTPS. This can be done by creating a redirect rule that redirects HTTP requests on port 80 to HTTPS requests on port 443.

Update the DNS record: The DNS record for the website should be updated to point to the ALB's DNS name, so that all traffic is routed through the ALB.

Verify the configuration: Once the configuration is complete, the website should be tested to ensure that all requests are being redirected to HTTPS. This can be done by accessing the website using HTTP and verifying that the request is redirected to HTTPS.

To redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, a solutions architect should create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Option A is not correct because network ACLs do not have the ability to redirect traffic. Option B is not correct because it does not redirect traffic, it only replaces the URL. Option D is not correct because a Network Load Balancer does not have the ability to handle HTTPS traffic.

     The correct solution is C. Store the database credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation for the secret. Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the secret.

AWS Secrets Manager is a service that enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. By storing the database credentials as a secret in Secrets Manager, you can ensure that they are not hardcoded in the application and that they are automatically rotated on a regular basis. To grant the EC2 instance access to the secret, you can attach the required permission to the EC2 role. This will allow the application to retrieve the secret from Secrets Manager as needed.

       Option A, storing the database credentials in the instance metadata and using a Lambda function to update them, would not meet the requirement of not hardcoding the credentials in the application. 

Option B, storing the database credentials in an encrypted S3 bucket and using a Lambda function to update them, would also not meet this requirement, as the application would still need to access the credentials from the configuration file.

     Storing the credentials in Secrets Manager provides dedicated and secure management. With automatic rotation enabled, Secrets Manager handles the credential updates automatically. Attaching the necessary permissions to the EC2 role allows the application to securely access the secret.

This approach minimizes operational overhead and provides a secure and managed solution for credential management.

     It's a third-party certificate, hence AWS cannot manage renewal automatically. The closest thing you can do is to send a notification to renew the 3rd party certificate.

     It is D, because ACM does not manage the renewal process for imported certificates. You are responsible for monitoring the expiration date of your imported certificates and for renewing them before they expire.

     Yes it's D. Here is a clear explanation. 

Imported certificates – If you want to use a third-party certificate with Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon API Gateway, you may import it into ACM using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or ACM APIs. ACM can not renew imported certificates, but it can help you manage the renewal process. You are responsible for monitoring the expiration date of your imported certificates and for renewing them before they expire. You can use ACM CloudWatch metrics to monitor the expiration dates of an imported certificates and import a new third-party certificate to replace an expiring one.

AB will create a new certificate in AWS
C will also create a new certificate but this is not what PCA are for *=(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html)

     internal CA are typically trusted only within the organization unless you manually distribute and trust the root certificate elsewhere

external CA:
Certificates from a well-known external CA are trusted by most browsers and systems by default

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-certificate.html
"Public certificates that you request through ACM are obtained from Amazon Trust Services, an Amazon managed public certificate authority (CA). ... Any browser, application, or OS that includes the Amazon or Starfield roots will trust public certificates obtained from ACM."

The answer is A, different story if they said external certificate

     The key points are:

Obtain certificate from external CA, not ACM
Import the external certificate into ACM
Apply imported certificate to the ALB
Set up EventBridge rule to trigger notification on certificate expiration
Manually renew and rotate the external certificate each year.

     D: With this approach, you import the third-party certificate into ACM, which allows you to centrally manage and apply it to the ALB. By configuring CloudWatch Events, you can receive notifications when the certificate is close to expiring, prompting you to manually initiate the rotation process.

A &amp; B: These options assume that the SSL/TLS certificate can be issued directly by ACM. However, since the requirement specifies that the certificate should be issued by an external certificate authority (CA), this option is not suitable.

C: ACM Private Certificate Authority is used when you want to create your own private CA and issue certificates from it. It does not support certificates issued by external CAs. Therefore, this option is not suitable for the given requirement.

     B. Using DynamoDB for storing and processing large .pdf files would not be cost-effective due to storage and throughput costs associated with DynamoDB.

C. Using Elastic Beanstalk with EC2 and EBS storage can work, but it may not be most cost-effective solution. It involves managing the underlying infrastructure and scaling manually.

D. Similar to C, using Elastic Beanstalk with EC2 and EFS storage can work, but it may not be most cost-effective solution. EFS is a shared file storage service and may not provide optimal performance for conversion process, especially as demand and file sizes increase.

A. leverages Lambda and the scalable and cost-effective storage of S3. With Lambda, you only pay for actual compute time used during the file conversion, and S3 provides durable and scalable storage for both .pdf files and .jpg files. The S3 PUT event triggers Lambda to perform conversion, eliminating need to manage infrastructure and scaling, making it most cost-effective solution for this scenario.

     Given the company's requirement for access to both AWS and on-premises file storage with minimum latency and no significant changes to existing file access patterns, the most suitable option is:

A. Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Move the on-premises file data to FSx for Windows File Server. Reconfigure the workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS.

     Option A is the most cost-effective solution that meets the requirements. Here is why:

Storing the PDFs in Amazon S3 is inexpensive and scalable storage.
Using S3 events to trigger Lambda functions to do the file conversion is a serverless approach that scales automatically. No need to manage EC2 instances.
Lambda usage is charged only for compute time used, which is cost-efficient for spiky workloads like this.
Storing the converted JPGs back in S3 keeps the storage scalable and cost-effective.

     Since this requires a cost-effect solution then you can use Lambda  to convert pdf files to jpeg and store them on S3. Lambda is serverless, so only pay when you use it and automatically scales to cope with demand.

     if Option A is correct, however storing the data back to the same S3, wont it cause infinite looping, it's not best practice right storing a object that is processed by Lambda function to the same S3 bucket, it has chances to cause infinite Loop and then if the option B cant we increase the limits of Dynamo DB requesting AWS?

     This solution will meet the company's requirements in a cost-effective manner because it uses a serverless architecture with AWS Lambda to convert the files and store them in S3. The Lambda function will automatically scale to meet the demand for file conversions and S3 will automatically scale to store the original and converted files as needed.

       Agree answer is D)
---
Requirements are:
- "Users and applications interact with the data each day"
- "the company requires access to AWS and on-premises file storage with minimum latency"
---
Explanation: Answer A) will work with the same on-prem &lt;&gt; aws latency as in answer D) as both use the VPN Connection. Having said this, by using an Amazon FSx File Gateway on premise as the D) scenario mentioned, all users will have a great benefit on using the cache that the FSx File Gateway has on their daily workloads. And that is part of the requierements: "users", "each day", "latency"

       I think D is correct. The FSx File gateway will look like any other Windows file share to the on-prem clients so when they write, or "Copy" data to the share it will be be cached locally and also written to the FSx service in the cloud. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/filefsxw/file-gateway-fsx-concepts.html

         The problem with cache is - It needs to refreshed, which is an overkill for a migration project
The cache refresh requires another solution since the users/applications interact with it daily which means it does modify often.

     Bad question.
A - Doesn't meet the "low latency" requirement due to VPN connection.
D - It's not possible to "move file data to FSx File Gateway". Instead, it provides improved latency with local caching.
B and C -  wrong, since the question requires "no significant changes to the existing file access patterns"

I'd go with D, but not 100% happy with it.

     Option D suggests deploying both Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS and an Amazon FSx File Gateway on premises. While this option may provide a solution for accessing on-premises file data in AWS, it introduces additional complexity and potential overhead that may not be necessary given the company's existing AWS Site-to-Site VPN connectivity.

Here are some reasons why Option D may not be the most suitable choice:
Complexity, Cost, Redundancy and Operational Overhead.

       Both Amazon FSx file gateway on-prem and Amazon FSx for windows file server goes hand in hand. So there is no way you can use the file gateway on-Prem and not use the Fsx for windows file server. Your conclusion of adding more overhead does not hold. Hence D is the perfect answer.
Configure the cloud workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Configure the on-premises workloads to use the FSx File Gateway.

       A VPN or DX connection is required for FSx File gateway. Option D provides low mantiance as FSx for Windows is a managed service and the file gateway will provide the low latency access required by the on-prem services.

     To meet the company's requirements of accessing both AWS and on-premises file storage with minimum latency, while minimizing operational overhead and maintaining existing file access patterns, a solutions architect should choose

Option A: Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. This option allows for the deployment of FSx for Windows File Server on AWS, facilitating the migration of on-premises file data to FSx.

By reconfiguring the workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS, the company can ensure seamless access to the file data while leveraging the benefits of AWS infrastructure.

This solution aligns with the company's objective of moving Windows workloads to AWS and utilizes the existing AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection for connectivity.

     Amazon FSx File Gateway is a service that provides low latency and efficient access to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server shares from on-premises facilities. It helps eliminate on-premises file servers and consolidates all the data into AWS to take advantage of the scale and economics of cloud storage

     A does not include any on-premises component, thus it can't meet the "access to ... on-premises file storage with minimum latency" requirement. B and C use S3 which cannot be directly accessed by the Windows servers they are going to move to AWS.

     Option A is correct because 
- minimum latency
-minimum operational overhead
-requires no significant changes to the existing file access patterns

Option D is incorrect -
-Amazon FSx File Gateway on premises, which would add additional complexity and potential latency, , as the data would need to be transferred between the on-premises gateway and AWS. These options would also require reconfiguring the workloads to use the gateways, which could involve significant changes to the existing file access patterns.
-unnecessary complexity and potential latency

     The correct solution is C: Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.

Option C: Using Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports, and Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text, would be the most efficient solution as it would involve the least operational overhead.

       Option A: Using existing Python libraries to extract the text and identify the PHI from the text would require the hospital to maintain and update the libraries as needed. This would involve operational overhead in terms of keeping the libraries up to date and debugging any issues that may arise.

Option B: Using Amazon SageMaker to identify the PHI from the extracted text would involve additional operational overhead in terms of setting up and maintaining a SageMaker model, as well as potentially incurring additional costs for using SageMaker.

Option D: Using Amazon Rekognition to extract the text from the reports would not be an effective solution, as Rekognition is primarily designed for image recognition and would not be able to accurately extract text from PDF or JPEG files.

     Both Rekognition and Textract possess the ability to detect text within images, yet they are optimized for differing applications.

Rekognition specializes in identifying text located spatially within an image, for instance, words displayed on street signs, t-shirts, or license plates. Its typical use cases encompass visual search, content filtering, deriving insights from content, among others. However, it's not the ideal choice for images containing more than 100 words, as this exceeds its limitation.

On the other hand, Textract is tailored more towards processing documents and PDFs, offering a comprehensive suite for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It proves useful in scenarios involving financial reports, medical records, receipts, ID documents, and more.

     • Amazon Textract: This program is made to extract text and data from scanned documents, such as pictures and PDFs. It helps to retain the formatting of the report by automatically extracting text while preserving the document's layout.

    Identifying and extracting medical information, including protected health information (PHI), from unstructured text is the specialty of Amazon Comprehend Medical.

     Here's why:

Amazon Textract has built-in support to extract text from PDFs and images, eliminating the need to build this yourself with Python libraries.
Amazon Comprehend Medical has pre-trained machine learning models to identify PHI entities out-of-the-box, avoiding the need to train your own SageMaker model.
Using these fully managed AWS services minimizes operational overhead of maintaining machine learning models yourself.

     C leverages capabilities of Textract, which is a service that automatically extracts text and data from documents, including PDF and JPEG. By using Textract, hospital can extract text content from reports without need for additional custom code or libraries.

Once text is extracted, hospital can then use Comprehend Medical, a natural language processing service specifically designed for medical text, to analyze and identify PHI. It can recognize medical entities such as medical conditions, treatments, and patient information.

A. suggests using existing Python libraries, which would require hospital to develop and maintain custom code for text extraction and PHI identification.

B and D involve using Textract along with SageMaker or Rekognition, respectively, for PHI identification. While these options could work, they introduce additional complexity by incorporating machine learning models and training.

If they do not explicitly mention that they are using Glacier Instant Retrieval, we should assume that Glacier -&gt; takes more time to retrieve and may not meet the requirements

         "With S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, you can save up to 68% on storage costs compared to using the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class, when your data is accessed once per quarter." Repeat: once per quarter! Plus if you keep all the data forever, even if on Glacier, it will cost more over time, than storing on a higher-cost storage for a period of time (here: 4 yrs). A does not delete.

         I think his assumption is correct because if you go to AWS documentation (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/) they clearly mention: "S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier)". So since this question doesn't specify the S3 Glacier class, then it would default to flexible retrieval (which ofc is not equal to Instant Retrieval).

     Most COST EFFECTIVE
A:  S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is a new storage class that delivers the fastest access to archive storage, with the same low latency and high-throughput performance as the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes. You can save up to 68 percent on storage costs as compared with using the S3 Standard-IA storage class when you use the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class and pay a low price to retrieve data.

"S3 Glacier Retrieval is the lowest cost archive storage with milliseconds retrieval for rarely accessed data. It is ideal for data that is accessed once or twice per quarter, and that requires immediate access."

     I am going to go with B. Reasoning = 
A = even if Glacier Instant Retrieval was used here, you can only use that quick retrieval once a quarter which isn't what the prompt is asking for.
B - One Zone is the cheapest option, and the prompt does not ask for high availability.
C / D - see reasoning for B

     S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) is cheaper than S3 Standard and S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) but still offers immediate accessibility.
Since the files are rarely accessed after the first 30 days, transitioning them to S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days will reduce costs.
The 4-year retention period aligns with the company policy, and after this period, the files can be deleted.
Option C suggests moving the files from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days, which is a more expensive storage class compared to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA).

Since the files are rarely accessed after the first 30 days, moving them to S3 Standard-IA would result in higher storage costs compared to moving them to S3 One Zone-IA.

Therefore, option B is more cost-effective than option C.

     Option C: Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days from object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.

Options A, B, and D have drawbacks:

Option A: Transitioning to S3 Glacier might introduce retrieval times and costs, which may not be suitable for files that require immediate accessibility. Deleting directly after 4 years is a more straightforward approach.

Option B: S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) is less durable than Standard or Standard-Infrequent Access, as it stores data in a single availability zone. This may not be ideal for critical business data.

Option D: Transitioning to S3 Glacier after 4 years introduces retrieval times and costs, which might not align with the immediate accessibility requirement. It adds complexity without a clear benefit in this scenario.

     In case of SQS - multi-consumers if one consumer has already picked the message and is processing, in meantime other consumer can pick it up and process the message there by two copies are added at the end. To avoid this the message is made invisible from the time its picked and deleted after processing. This visibility timeout is increased according to max time taken to process the message

       To add to this "The VisibilityTimeout in SQS is a time frame that the message can be hidden so that no others can consume it except the first consumer who calls the ReceiveMessageAPI." The API ChangeMesssageVisibility changes this value.

     To ensure that messages are being processed only once, a solutions architect should use the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to increase the visibility timeout which is Option D.

The visibility timeout determines the amount of time that a message received from an SQS queue is hidden from other consumers while the message is being processed. If the processing of a message takes longer than the visibility timeout, the message will become visible to other consumers and may be processed again. By increasing the visibility timeout, the solutions architect can ensure that the message is not made visible to other consumers until the processing is complete and the message can be safely deleted from the queue.

Option A (Use the CreateQueue API call to create a new queue) would not address the issue of duplicate message processing. 

Option B (Use the AddPermission API call to add appropriate permissions) is not relevant to this issue. 

Option C (Use the ReceiveMessage API call to set an appropriate wait time) is also not relevant to this issue.

         Option B (Use the AddPermission API call to add appropriate permissions) is not relevant to this issue because it deals with setting permissions for accessing an SQS queue, which is not related to preventing duplicate records in the RDS table.

Option C (Use the ReceiveMessage API call to set an appropriate wait time) is not relevant to this issue because it is related to configuring how long the ReceiveMessage API call should wait for new messages to arrive in the SQS queue before returning an empty response. It does not address the issue of duplicate records in the RDS table.

       This parameter is the timeout after which the SQS assumes that the processing has failed and makes the item visible to other que processors. It is normal to increase the timeout if it takes longer to process items.

     The visibility timeout is the duration during which SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the same message. By increasing the visibility timeout, you allow more time for the processing of a message to complete before it becomes visible to other consumers.

Option A, creating a new queue, does not address the issue of concurrent processing and duplicate records. It would only create a new queue, which is not necessary for solving the problem.

Option B, adding permissions, also does not directly address the issue of duplicate records. Permissions are necessary for accessing the SQS queue but not for preventing concurrent processing.

Option C, setting an appropriate wait time using the ReceiveMessage API call, does not specifically prevent duplicate records. It can help manage the rate at which messages are received from the queue but does not address the issue of concurrent processing.

     Options B and C propose using multiple VPN connections for private connectivity and as backups. While VPNs can serve as backups, they may not provide the same level of consistent low latency and high availability as Direct Connect connections. Additionally, provisioning multiple VPN tunnels can increase operational complexity and costs.

Option D suggests using the Direct Connect failover attribute from the AWS CLI to automatically create a backup connection if the primary Direct Connect connection fails. While this approach can be automated, it does not provide the same level of immediate failover capabilities as having a separate backup connection in place.

Therefore, option A, provisioning an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region and provisioning a VPN connection as a backup, is the most suitable solution that meets the company's requirements for connectivity, cost-effectiveness, and high availability.

     Option A is the correct solution to meet the requirements of the company. Provisioning an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region will provide a private and dedicated connection with consistent low latency. As the company requires a highly available connection, a VPN connection can be provisioned as a backup if the primary Direct Connect connection fails. This approach will minimize costs and provide the required level of availability.

     With AWS Direct Connect + VPN, you can combine AWS Direct Connect dedicated network connections with the Amazon VPC VPN. This solution combines the benefits of the end-to-end secure IPSec connection with low latency and increased bandwidth of the AWS Direct Connect to provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based VPN connections.

     By configuring the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones, the application will be able to continue running even if one Availability Zone goes down. Configuring the database as Multi-AZ will also ensure that the database remains available in the event of a failure in one Availability Zone. Using an Amazon RDS Proxy instance for the database will allow the application to automatically route traffic to healthy database instances, further increasing the availability of the application. This solution will meet the requirements for high availability with minimal operational effort.

       One of the benefits of Amazon RDS Proxy is that it can improve application recovery time after database failovers. While RDS Proxy supports both MySQL as well as PostgreSQL engines, in this post, we will use a MySQL test workload to demonstrate how RDS Proxy reduces client recovery time after failover by up to 79% for Amazon Aurora MySQL and by up to 32% for Amazon RDS for MySQL.

     The company wants to minimize costs and is willing to accept slower traffic if the primary connection fails, it may be tempted to choose a VPN connection as a backup, in which case the answer is  A. Cost-Effectiveness: VPN connections are generally more economical than AWS Direct Connect, especially for low to moderate bandwidth needs.
Backup connection: A VPN connection can serve as a more cost-effective backup if the primary Direct Connect connection fails, even if it may be slower. Acceptance of slower traffic: The question clearly states that the company is willing to accept slower traffic if the primary connection fails, which implies a tolerance for connection speeds.

     Option B requires the least operational effort to meet the high availability and minimum downtime/data loss requirements.

The key points are:

Use an Auto Scaling group across multiple AZs for high availability of the EC2 instances.
Configure the Aurora DB as Multi-AZ for high availability, automatic failover, and minimum data loss.
Use RDS Proxy for connection pooling to the DB for performance

     A. This approach provides geographic redundancy, it introduces additional complexity and operational effort, including managing replication, handling latency, and potentially higher data transfer costs.

C. While snapshots can be used for data backup and recovery, they do not provide real-time failover capabilities and can result in significant data loss if a failure occurs between snapshots.

D. While this approach offers some decoupling and scalability benefits, it adds complexity to the data flow and introduces additional overhead for data processing.

In comparison, option B provides a simpler and more streamlined solution by utilizing multiple AZs, Multi-AZ configuration for the database, and RDS Proxy for improved connection management. It ensures high availability, minimal downtime, and minimum loss of data with the least operational effort.

     @Wajif the reason why it's not A is because the question mentions High availability and nothing to do with region. You can achieve HA without spanning multiple regions. Also B is incorrect because ALB are region specific and span across multiple AZ with that specific region (not cross region)

     The correct solution is B: Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones. Configure the database as Multi-AZ. Configure an Amazon RDS Proxy instance for the database.

This solution will meet the requirements of high availability with minimum downtime and minimum loss of data with the least operational effort. By configuring the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones, the web application will be able to withstand the failure of one Availability Zone without any disruption to the service. By configuring the database as Multi-AZ, the database will automatically failover to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone in the event of a failure, ensuring minimal downtime. Additionally, using an RDS Proxy instance will help to improve the performance and scalability of the database.

         NLBs support HTTP, HTTPS and TCP health checks:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-health-checks.html (check HealthCheckProtocol)

But NLBs only accept either selecting EC2 instances or IP addresses directly as targets. You can't provide a URL to your endpoints, only a health check path (if you're using HTTP or HTTPS health checks).

     You can use HTTP/HTTPS ONLY when Target is ALB.
By default it is TCP.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-health-checks.html#health-check-settings
HealthCheckProtocol
The protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. The possible protocols are HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP. The default is the TCP protocol. If the target type is ALB, the supported health check protocols are HTTP and HTTPS.

     The key points are:

Configure HTTP health checks on the ALB to monitor the application health.
Use an Auto Scaling action triggered by the ALB health checks to automatically replace unhealthy instances.

     A. NLB, but NLB's health checks are designed for TCP/UDP protocols and lack the advanced features specific to HTTP applications provided by ALB.

B. This approach involves custom scripting and manual intervention, which contradicts the requirement of not writing custom scripts or code.

D. Since the NLB does not detect HTTP errors, relying solely on the UnhealthyHostCount metric may not accurately capture the health of the application instances.

Therefore, C is the recommended choice for improving the application's availability without custom scripting or code. By replacing the NLB with an ALB, enabling HTTP health checks, and configuring Auto Scaling to replace unhealthy instances, the company can ensure that only healthy instances are serving traffic, enhancing the application's availability automatically.

     must be C

Application availability: NLB cannot assure the availability of the application. This is because it bases its decisions solely on network and TCP-layer variables and has no awareness of the application at all. Generally, NLB determines availability based on the ability of a server to respond to ICMP ping or to correctly complete the three-way TCP handshake. ALB goes much deeper and is capable of determining availability based on not only a successful HTTP GET of a particular page but also the verification that the content is as was expected based on the input parameters.

     Answer is C

A solution architect can use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling health checks to automatically detect and replace unhealthy instances in the EC2 Auto Scaling group. The health checks can be configured to check the HTTP errors returned by the application and terminate the unhealthy instances. This will ensure that the application's availability is improved, without requiring custom scripts or code.

     Correct answer - C
Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to:
• Forward TCP &amp; UDP traffic to your instances
• Handle millions of request per seconds
• Less latency ~100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
Best choice for HTTP traffic - replace to Application load balancer

       Yes, it is possible to take EBS snapshots of a DynamoDB table. The process for doing this involves the following steps:

Create a new Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume from the DynamoDB table.

Stop the DynamoDB service on the instance.

Detach the EBS volume from the instance.

Create a snapshot of the EBS volume.

Reattach the EBS volume to the instance.

Start the DynamoDB service on the instance.

You can also use AWS Data pipeline to automate the above process and schedule regular snapshots of your DynamoDB table.

Note that, if your table is large and you want to take a snapshot of it, it could take a long time and consume a lot of bandwidth, so it's recommended to use the Global Tables feature from DynamoDB in order to have a Multi-region and Multi-master DynamoDB table, and you can snapshot each region separately.

     The best solution to meet the RPO and RTO requirements would be to use DynamoDB point-in-time recovery (PITR). This feature allows you to restore your DynamoDB table to any point in time within the last 35 days, with a granularity of seconds. To recover data within a 15-minute RPO, you would simply restore the table to the desired point in time within the last 35 days.

To meet the RTO requirement of 1 hour, you can use the DynamoDB console, AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs to enable PITR on your table. Once enabled, PITR continuously captures point-in-time copies of your table data in an S3 bucket. You can then use these point-in-time copies to restore your table to any point in time within the retention period.

***CORRECT***
Option B. Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time.

       ***WRONG***
Option A (configuring DynamoDB global tables) would not meet the RPO requirement, as global tables are designed to replicate data to multiple regions for high availability, but they do not provide a way to restore data to a specific point in time.

Option C (exporting data to S3 Glacier) would not meet the RPO or RTO requirements, as S3 Glacier is a cold storage service with a retrieval time of several hours.

Option D (scheduling EBS snapshots) would not meet the RPO requirement, as EBS snapshots are taken on a schedule, rather than continuously. Additionally, restoring a DynamoDB table from an EBS snapshot can take longer than 1 hour, so it would not meet the RTO requirement.

     With point-in-time recovery, you can restore that table to any point in time during the last 35 days. After you enable point-in-time recovery, you can restore to any point in time from five minutes before the current time until 35 days ago. DynamoDB maintains incremental backups of your table.

     The best option to meet the RPO of 15 minutes and RTO of 1 hour is B) Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time.

The key points:

DynamoDB point-in-time recovery can restore to any point in time within the last 35 days. This supports an RPO of 15 minutes.
Restoring from a point-in-time backup meets the 1 hour RTO.
Point-in-time recovery is specifically designed to restore DynamoDB tables with second-level granularity.

     A. Global tables provide multi-region replication for disaster recovery purposes, they may not meet the desired RPO of 15 minutes without additional configuration and potential data loss.

C. Exporting and importing data on a daily basis does not align with the desired RPO of 15 minutes.

D. EBS snapshots can be used for data backup, they are not directly applicable to DynamoDB and cannot provide the desired RPO and RTO without custom implementation.

In comparison, option B utilizing DynamoDB's built-in point-in-time recovery functionality provides the most straightforward and effective solution for meeting the specified RPO of 15 minutes and RTO of 1 hour. By enabling PITR and restoring the table to the desired point in time, the company can recover the customer information with minimal data loss and within the required time frame.

     B is correct
DynamoDB point-in-time recovery allows the solutions architect to recover the DynamoDB table to a specific point in time, which would meet the RPO of 15 minutes. This feature also provides an RTO of 1 hour, which is the desired recovery time objective for the application. Additionally, configuring DynamoDB point-in-time recovery does not require any additional infrastructure or operational effort, making it the best solution for this scenario.
Option D is not correct because scheduling Amazon EBS snapshots for the DynamoDB table every 15 minutes would not meet the RPO or RTO requirements. While EBS snapshots can be used to recover data from a DynamoDB table, they are not designed to provide real-time data protection or recovery capabilities

     ***CORRECT***
The correct answer is Option D. Deploy an S3 VPC gateway endpoint into the VPC and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets.

By deploying an S3 VPC gateway endpoint, the application can access the S3 buckets over a private network connection within the VPC, eliminating the need for data transfer over the internet. This can help reduce data transfer fees as well as improve the performance of the application. The endpoint policy can be used to specify which S3 buckets the application has access to.

       ***WRONG***
Option A, deploying Amazon API Gateway into a public subnet and adjusting the route table, would not address the issue of data transfer fees as the application would still be transferring data over the internet. 

Option B, deploying a NAT gateway into a public subnet and attaching an endpoint policy, would not address the issue of data transfer fees either as the NAT gateway is used to enable outbound internet access for instances in a private subnet, rather than for connecting to S3. 

Option C, deploying the application into a public subnet and allowing it to route through an internet gateway, would not reduce data transfer fees as the application would still be transferring data over the internet.

     The best solution to reduce data transfer costs for an application frequently accessing S3 buckets in the same region is option D - Deploy an S3 VPC gateway endpoint into the VPC and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets.

The key points:
- S3 gateway endpoints allow private connections between VPCs and S3 without going over the public internet.
- This avoids data transfer fees for traffic between the VPC and S3 within the same region.
- An endpoint policy controls access to specific S3 buckets.

     A. API Gateway can serve as a proxy for S3 requests, it adds unnecessary complexity and additional costs compared to a direct VPC endpoint.

B. Using a NAT gateway for accessing S3 introduces unnecessary data transfer costs as traffic would still flow over the internet.

C. This approach would incur data transfer fees as the traffic would go through the public internet.

In comparison, option D using an S3 VPC gateway endpoint provides a direct and cost-effective solution for accessing S3 buckets within the same Region. By keeping the data transfer within the AWS network infrastructure, it helps reduce data transfer fees and provides secure access to the S3 resources.

     Selected Answer: D
FYI : 
-There is no additional charge for using gateway endpoints.
-Interface endpoints are priced at ~ $0.01/per AZ/per hour. Cost depends on the Region
- S3 Interface Endpoints resolve to private VPC IP addresses and are routable from outside the VPC (e.g via VPN, Direct Connect, Transit Gateway, etc). S3 Gateway Endpoints use public IP ranges and are only routable from resources within the VPC.

     I've noticed that it is very important to focus on the logic for the solution, not just services.

For example, in this question, the goal is to access the application instances only from the bastion while keeping them in the private subnet, which already suggests that the SSH connection must be allowed for the bastion private IP. This is answer D.

 On the other hand, the bastion must accept connections only from the company's premises, which already eliminates option A. Option B is wrong because internal IP is used only internally; in this case, the connection will be through the internet, which means that it must be the external IP; therefore, answer C.

D: app instance in private subnet should only allow access from bastion

       Good way to remember this one is to think of movie scene where someone is visiting a prisoner in a prison and talks to them from behind a glass using a 2 way phone.

Visitor is in company
Visitor area is public subnet
Prisoner area is private subnet
Phone is bastion

Visitor (company) must only be allowed to use the phone (bastion) from the public area (public subnet) and the phone (bastion) must only be allowed to talk to the prisoner in the prisoner area (private subnet)

     C. This will restrict access to the bastion host from the specific IP range of the on-premises network, ensuring secure connectivity. This step ensures that only authorized users from the on-premises network can access the bastion host.

D. This step enables SSH connectivity from the bastion host to the application instances in the private subnet. By allowing inbound SSH access only from the private IP address of the bastion host, you ensure that SSH access is restricted to the bastion host only.

     Application is in private subnet 
Bastion Host is in public subnet 

D does not make sense because the bastion host is in public subnet and they don't have a private IP but only a public IP address attached to them. The IP wanting to connect is Public as well. 

Bastion host in public subnet allows external IP (via internet) of the company to access it. Which than leaves us to give permission to the application private subnet and for that the private subnet with the application accepts the IP coming from Bastion Host by changing its SG. C&amp;E

       Bastion host in public subnet because it has a public IP and a NAT Gateway that can route traffic out of your AWS VPC but it does have the ability to access the private subnet using private IP since it's not leaving AWS to access the private subnet. So C&amp;D are the right answers.

     The security group for the web tier should allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0. This will allow clients to connect to the web tier using HTTPS. The security group for the web tier should also allow outbound traffic on port 443 to 0.0.0.0/0. This will allow the web tier to connect to the internet to download updates and other resources.

The security group for the database tier should allow inbound traffic on port 1433 from the security group for the web tier. This will allow the web tier to connect to the database tier to access data. The security group for the database tier should not allow outbound traffic on ports 443 and 1433 to the security group for the web tier. This will prevent the database tier from being exposed to the public internet.

     A. This configuration allows external users to access the web tier over HTTPS (port 443). However, it's important to note that it is generally recommended to restrict the source IP range to a more specific range rather than allowing access from 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere). This would limit access to only trusted sources.

C. By allowing inbound traffic on port 1433 (default port for Microsoft SQL Server) from the security group associated with the web tier, you ensure that the database tier can only be accessed by the EC2 instances in the web tier. This provides a level of isolation and restricts direct access to the database tier from external sources.

     A &amp; C are the correct answer. 

Inbound traffic to the web tier on port 443 (HTTPS) 
The web tier will then access the Database tier on port 1433 - inbound.

     ***CORRECT***
The correct answers are C and E.

For security purposes, it is best practice to limit inbound and outbound traffic as much as possible. In this case, the web tier should only be able to access the database tier and not the other way around. Therefore, the security group for the web tier should only allow outbound traffic to the security group for the database tier on the necessary ports. Similarly, the security group for the database tier should only allow inbound traffic from the security group for the web tier on the necessary ports.

Answer C: Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on port 1433 from the security group for the web tier. This is correct because the web tier needs to be able to connect to the database on port 1433 in order to access the data.

***WRONG***
Answer A: Configure the security group for the web tier to allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0. This is not correct because the web tier should not allow inbound traffic from the internet. Instead, it should only allow outbound traffic to the security group for the database tier.

         "The web tier needs to be able to connect to the database on both port 443 and 1433 in order to access the data" -&gt; Nonsense, SQL Server needs only tcp/1433. Or tcp/1433 + udp/1433 plus the instance port if you have multiple instances. But you NEVER need tcp/443 to access SQL Server.

     You want to "modernize the application", that a modern application is serverless, in any case a modern application does NOT use EC2 instances. Also, managing EC2 instances (with the OS etc pp) is NOT "operationally efficient". Thus not D.

     For me the solution could be based on using SNS with multiple topics to organize communication between different tiers ( Using Subscriber for one and Producer for another topic to proceed with transactions over multi-tiers ). CloudWatch to monitor SNS topics queue length and scale up/down based on counts of messages (NumberOfMessagesPublished)

       The question asks for the most operationally efficient solution. The answer A is serverless, while the answer C is VM-based. There is no scenario where managin VMs is operationally more efficient than going serverless.
If Operational Efficiency is what you look for, then you should always consider going serverless.

     A and D are both good solution however A will suffice the requirement as it is the most operational efficient for modern applications, AWS Lambda will scale elastically when application will become overloaded and the fact that it is serverless. SQS will handle the queue as well..

     This solution addresses the issue of dropped transactions by decoupling the communication between application tiers using SQS. It ensures that transactions are not lost even if one tier becomes overloaded.

By using EC2 in ASG, the application can automatically scale based on the demand and the length of the SQS. This allows for efficient utilization of resources and ensures that the application can handle increased workload and communication failures.

CloudWatch is used to monitor the length of SQS. When queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential communication failures, the ASG can be configured to scale up by adding more instances to handle the load.

D. This solution utilizes Lambda and API Gateway, which can be a valid approach for building serverless applications. However, it may introduce additional complexity and operational overhead compared to the requirement of modernizing an existing multi-tiered application.

       Supposing the solution is D), what is the point of monitoring the SQS queue length if then the system scales up when communication failures are detected? Why not monitoring the amount of failures? Is it ok to assume that when the queue grows the system is failing? What is the system is under more demand? So, my guess, the solution is A)

     ***CORRECT***
The most reliable solution for transferring the data in a secure manner would be option B: AWS DataSync over AWS Direct Connect.

AWS DataSync is a data transfer service that uses network optimization techniques to transfer data efficiently and securely between on-premises storage systems and Amazon S3 or other storage targets. When used over AWS Direct Connect, DataSync can provide a dedicated and secure network connection between your on-premises data center and AWS. This can help to ensure a more reliable and secure data transfer compared to using the public internet.

Option A, AWS DataSync over the public internet, is not as reliable as using Direct Connect, as it can be subject to potential network issues or congestion. 

Option C, AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) over the public internet, is not a suitable solution for transferring large amounts of data, as it is designed for migrating databases rather than transferring large amounts of data from a storage area network (SAN). 

Option D, AWS DMS over AWS Direct Connect, is also not a suitable solution, as it is designed for migrating databases and may not be efficient for transferring large amounts of data from a SAN.

     DataSync is a service specifically designed for data transfer and synchronization between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services like S3. It provides reliable and efficient data transfer capabilities, ensuring the secure movement of large volumes of data.

By leveraging Direct Connect, which establishes a dedicated network connection between the on-premises data center and AWS, the data transfer is conducted over a private and dedicated network link. This approach offers increased reliability, lower latency, and consistent network performance compared to transferring data over the public internet.

Database Migration Service is primarily focused on database migration and replication, and it may not be the most appropriate tool for general-purpose data transfer like JSON files.

Transferring data over the public internet may introduce potential security risks and performance variability due to factors like network congestion, latency, and potential interruptions.

         It is because they assume that Kinesis Data Firehose built-in transformations are not enough. So you have to use specific lambda transformation.

       The real-time part (data ingestion) will be performed by Kinesis Data Stream and API Gateway. After this, the transformation and storage of the data don't need to be in real-time, since it was already ingested, so Kinesis Firehose + Lambda is perfect. C makes sense to me.

     Option C provides the least operational overhead to meet the requirements:

API Gateway provides the API
Kinesis Data Streams ingests the real-time data
Lambda functions transform the data
Firehose delivers the data to S3 storage
The key advantages are:

Serverless architecture requires minimal operational overhead
Fully managed ingestion, processing and storage services
No need to manage EC2 instances

     C. By leveraging these services together, you can achieve a real-time data ingestion architecture with minimal operational overhead. The data flows from the API Gateway to the Kinesis data stream, undergoes transformations with Lambda, and is then sent to S3 via the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream for storage.

A. This adds operational overhead as you need to handle EC2 management, scaling, and maintenance. It is less efficient compared to using a serverless solution like API Gateway.

B. It requires deploying and managing an EC2 to host the API and configuring Glue. This adds operational overhead, including EC2 management and potential scalability limitations.

D. It still requires managing and configuring Glue, which adds operational overhead. Additionally, it may not be the most efficient solution as Glue is primarily used for ETL scenarios, and in this case, real-time data transformation is required.

     I am gonna choose D for this.
Kinesis Data Stream + Data Firehose will adds up to the operational overhead, plus it is "Near real-time", not a real time solution.
Lambda functions scale automatically, so no management of scaling/compute resources is needed.
AWS Glue handles the data storage in S3, so no management of that is needed.

     option C is the best solution. It uses Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose which is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon S3. This service requires less operational overhead as compared to option A, B, and D. Additionally, it also uses Amazon API Gateway which is a fully managed service for creating, deploying, and managing APIs. These services help in reducing the operational overhead and automating the data ingestion process.

     Option C is the solution that meets the requirements with the least operational overhead.

In Option C, you can use Amazon API Gateway as a fully managed service to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs. This means that you don't have to worry about the operational overhead of deploying and maintaining an EC2 instance to host the API.

Option C also uses Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, which is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon S3. With Kinesis Data Firehose, you don't have to worry about the operational overhead of setting up and maintaining a data ingestion infrastructure.

       Finally, Option C uses AWS Lambda, which is a fully managed service for running code in response to events. With AWS Lambda, you don't have to worry about the operational overhead of setting up and maintaining a server to run the data transformation code.

Overall, Option C provides a fully managed solution for real-time data ingestion with minimal operational overhead.

         Option A is incorrect because it involves deploying an EC2 instance to host an API, which adds operational overhead in the form of maintaining and securing the instance.

Option B is incorrect because it involves deploying an EC2 instance to host an API and disabling source/destination checking on the instance. Disabling source/destination checking can make the instance vulnerable to attacks, which adds operational overhead in the form of securing the instance.

     Answer is B
"Amazon DynamoDB offers two types of backups: point-in-time recovery (PITR) and on-demand backups. (==&gt; D is not the answer)
PITR is used to recover your table to any point in time in a rolling 35 day window, which is used to help customers mitigate accidental deletes or writes to their tables from bad code, malicious access, or user error. (==&gt; A isn't the answer)
On demand backups are designed for long-term archiving and retention, which is typically used to help customers meet compliance and regulatory requirements.
This is the second of a series of two blog posts about using AWS Backup to set up scheduled on-demand backups for Amazon DynamoDB. Part 1 presents the steps to set up a scheduled backup for DynamoDB tables from the AWS Management Console." (==&gt; Not the DynamoBD console and C isn't the answer either)

     The most operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements would be to use option B, which is to use AWS Backup to create backup schedules and retention policies for the table.

AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate the backup of data across AWS resources. It allows you to create backup policies and schedules to automatically back up your DynamoDB tables on a regular basis. You can also specify retention policies to ensure that your backups are retained for the required period of time. This solution is fully automated and requires minimal maintenance, making it the most operationally efficient option.

       Option A, using DynamoDB point-in-time recovery, is also a viable option but it requires continuous backup, which may be more resource-intensive and may incur higher costs compared to using AWS Backup.

Option C, creating an on-demand backup of the table and storing it in an S3 bucket, is also a viable option but it requires manual intervention and does not provide the automation and scheduling capabilities of AWS Backup.

Option D, using Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) and a Lambda function to back up the table and store it in an S3 bucket, is also a viable option but it requires more complex setup and maintenance compared to using AWS Backup.

     AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that simplifies the process of creating and managing backups across various AWS services, including DynamoDB. It allows you to define backup schedules and retention policies to automatically take backups and retain them for the desired duration. By using AWS Backup, you can offload the operational overhead of managing backups to the service itself, ensuring that your data is protected and retained according to the specified retention period.

This solution is more efficient compared to the other options because it provides a centralized and automated backup management approach specifically designed for AWS services. It eliminates the need to manually configure and maintain backup processes, making it easier to ensure data retention compliance without significant operational effort.

     Choosing the On-Demand Capacity model (Option A) may cause performance issues during peak periods because it relies on DynamoDB to automatically adjust throughput based on actual usage, which may not be able to cope with sudden traffic increases in time.

Choosing a DynamoDB table with a global secondary index (option B) is independent of the capacity model and does not directly solve the problem of peak traffic.

Choosing to build DynamoDB tables in provisioned capacity mode and configure them as global tables (option D) may increase costs in some cases without necessarily providing the flexibility to accommodate unpredictable peak traffic.

     DynamoDB autoscaling takes 2 minutes to increase capacity. We need to handle it immediately. 
"Application Auto Scaling automatically scales the provisioned capacity only when the consumed capacity is higher than target utilization for two consecutive minutes".

     The costly part of (C) is you need to pay for what you order not what you have used for (A) On-Demand: A reserved capacity purchase is an agreement to pay for a minimum amount of provisioned throughput capacity, for the duration of the term of the agreement, in exchange for discounted pricing. If you use less than your reserved capacity, you will still be charged each month for that minimum amount of provisioned throughput capacity.

With on-demand capacity mode, DynamoDB charges you for the data reads and writes your application performs on your tables. You do not need to specify how much read and write throughput you expect your application to perform because DynamoDB instantly accommodates your workloads as they ramp up or down.

With provisioned capacity mode, you specify the number of reads and writes per second that you expect your application to require, and you are billed based on that. Furthermore if you can forecast your capacity requirements you can also reserve a portion of DynamoDB provisioned capacity and optimize your costs even further.

     By choosing provisioned capacity, you can allocate a specific amount of read and write capacity units based on your expected usage during peak times. This helps in cost optimization as you only pay for the provisioned capacity, which can be adjusted according to your anticipated traffic.

Enabling auto scaling allows DynamoDB to automatically adjust the provisioned capacity up or down based on the actual usage. This is beneficial in handling quick traffic spikes without manual intervention and ensuring that the required capacity is available to handle increased load efficiently. Auto scaling helps to optimize costs by dynamically adjusting the capacity to match the demand, avoiding overprovisioning during periods of low usage.

A. Creating a DynamoDB table in on-demand capacity mode, may not be the most cost-effective solution in this scenario. On-demand capacity mode charges you based on the actual usage of read and write requests, which can be beneficial for sporadic or unpredictable workloads. However, it may not be the optimal choice if the table is not used on most mornings.

     "On-demand" is a good option for applications that have unpredictable or sudden spikes, since it automatically provisions read/write capacity. 

"Provisioned capacity" is suitable for applications with predictable usage.

     Answer is A.
Provisioned capacity is best if you have relatively predictable application traffic, run applications whose traffic is consistent, and ramps up or down gradually.
On-demand capacity mode is best when you have unknown workloads, unpredictable application traffic and also if you only want to pay exactly for what you use. The on-demand pricing model is ideal for bursty, new, or unpredictable workloads whose traffic can spike in seconds or minutes, and when under-provisioned capacity would impact the user experience.

     On-demand capacity mode allows a DynamoDB table to automatically scale up or down based on the traffic to the table. This means that capacity will be allocated as needed and billing will be based on actual usage, providing flexibility in capacity while minimizing costs. This is an ideal choice for a table that is not used on most mornings and has unpredictable traffic spikes in the evenings.

     ***CORRECT***
B. Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. 

The most secure way for the solutions architect to share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account would be to modify the launchPermission property of the AMI and share it with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. The key policy should also be modified to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key. This ensures that the AMI is only shared with the MSP Partner and is encrypted with a key that they are authorized to use.

       Option A, making the AMI and snapshots publicly available, is not a secure option as it would allow anyone with access to the AMI to use it. 

Option C, modifying the key policy to trust a new KMS key owned by the MSP Partner, is also not a secure option as it would involve sharing the key with the MSP Partner, which could potentially compromise the security of the data encrypted with the key. 

Option D, exporting the AMI to an S3 bucket in the MSP Partner's AWS account and encrypting the S3 bucket with a new KMS key owned by the MSP Partner, is also not the most secure option as it involves sharing the AMI and a new key with the MSP Partner, which could potentially compromise the security of the data.

I was confused between B and C but read the article (link below). You have to allow the other account to use your key somehow otherwise they won't be able to use your AMI. C just allows a trust relationship with MSP's KMS, it won't give them access to your key.

     By modifying the launchPermission property of the AMI and sharing it with the MSP Partner's account only, the solutions architect restricts access to the AMI and ensures that it is not publicly available.

Additionally, modifying the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's account to use KMS customer managed key used for encrypting the EBS snapshots ensures that the MSP Partner has the necessary permissions to access and use the key for decryption.

Explanation why..
Making the AMI and snapshots publicly available, is not a secure option as it would allow anyone with access to the AMI to use it. Best practice would be to share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account then Modify launchPermission property of the AMI. This ensures that the AMI is shared only with the MSP Partner and is encrypted with a key that they are authorised to use.

       B costs more than D
To get a notification that your certificate is about to expire, use one of the following methods:

Use the ACM API in Amazon EventBridge to configure the ACM Certificate Approaching Expiration event.
Create a custom EventBridge rule to receive email notifications when certificates are nearing the expiration date.
Use AWS Config to check for certificates that are nearing the expiration date.
If you use AWS Config for this resolution, then be aware of the following:

Before you set up the AWS Config rule, create the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and EventBridge rule. This makes sure that all non-compliant certificates invoke a notification before the expiration date.
Activating AWS Config incurs an additional cost based on usage. For more information, see AWS Config pricing.

     The first of the two options I describe is to use the ACM built-in Certificate Expiration event, which is raised through Amazon EventBridge, to invoke a Lambda function. In this option, the function is configured to publish the result as a finding in Security Hub, and also as an SNS topic used for email subscriptions. As a result, an administrator can be notified of a specific expiring certificate, or an IT service management (ITSM) system can automatically open a case or incident through email or SNS.

"AWS Config is primarily designed for compliance monitoring rather than straightforward event detection like certificate expiration. It requires setting up compliance rules and monitoring them, which adds complexity.

By focusing directly on the task at hand, D minimizes operational overhead and simplifies the architecture, making it the better choice for the specific requirement of monitoring and alerting on certificate expiration."

     D
Not B because AWS Config is more suitable for monitoring configuration compliance rather than tracking the expiry of certificates. Setting up an AWS Config rule specifically for certificate expiration would be complex and less efficient compared to using EventBridge.

     The answer is D because:

If you want to set up notifications for more than 45 days before an event's expiration, then use the alternative following methods.

Create a custom EventBridge rule
Use a custom event pattern with an EventBridge rule to match the AWS Config managed rule acm-certificate-expiration-check. Then, route the response to an Amazon Simple Notification Service topic.

So if you want to be notified 30 days before expiration, you wont use aws config.

     The correct answer is B bc: (LeGloupier has a popular post on this)
https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/acm-certificate-expiration#:~:text=To%20get%20a%20notification%20that%20your%20certificate%20is%20about%20to%20expire%2C%20use%20one%20of%20the%20following%20methods%3A

D IS INCORRECT bc:
-Lambda is not necessary; AWS services (such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3 &amp; Amazon CloudWatch) can publish messages to your SNS topics to trigger event-driven computing and workflows. Using Lambda here goes against building the Well-Architected Framework pillar of Performance Efficiency. The more efficient solution is to use the managed service of AWS Config. 
-For those that argue against (B) bc of cost: The Cost Optimization pillar is upheld by (B) vs (D). Understanding how efficient your current architecture is in relation to your goals can remove unneeded expense. The goal is for the security team to be notified B4 expiration. If the certificate expires, there will be a far greater expense to pay.

     ***CORRECT***
C. Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the on-premises servers.

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of static and dynamic web content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos. By using CloudFront, the company can distribute the content of their website from edge locations that are closer to the users in Europe, reducing the loading times for these users.

To use CloudFront, the company can set up a custom origin pointing to their on-premises servers in the United States. CloudFront will then cache the content of the website at edge locations around the world and serve the content to users from the location that is closest to them. This will allow the company to optimize the loading times for their European users without having to move the backend of the website to a different region.

       ***WRONG***
Option A (launch an Amazon EC2 instance in us-east-1 and migrate the site to it) would not address the issue of optimizing loading times for European users. 

Option B (move the website to Amazon S3 and use Cross-Region Replication between Regions) would not be an immediate solution as it would require time to set up and migrate the website. 

Option D (use an Amazon Route 53 geoproximity routing policy pointing to on-premises servers) would not be suitable because it would not improve the loading times for users in Europe.

     Immediate solution is C
A: Requires site migration so won't be immediate
B: Dynamic site cannot work from S3
D: Geoproximity routing policy finds a server close to the user so this makes no sense
C: Not ideal but best option given the "immediate" requirement as CloudFront is a CDN so it will cache whatever is possible as close to the user giving best performance in this case (i.e. when compared to other options)

    <p>
     <strong>
      Comment:
     </strong>
     The key reasons are:

CloudFront can cache static content close to European users using edge locations, improving site performance.
The custom origin feature allows seamlessly integrating the CloudFront CDN with existing on-premises servers.
No changes are needed to the site backend or servers. CloudFront just acts as a globally distributed cache.
This can be set up very quickly, meeting the launch deadline.
Other options like migrating to EC2 or S3 would require more time and changes. CloudFront is an easier lift.
Route 53 geoproximity routing alone would not improve performance much without a CDN.

     <strong>
      Comment:
     </strong>
     C. This solution leverages the global network of CloudFront edge locations to cache and serve the website's static content from the edge locations closest to the European users.

A. Hosting the website in a single region would still result in increased latency for European users accessing the site.

B. Moving the website to S3 and implementing Cross-Region Replication would distribute the website's content across multiple regions, including Europe. S3 is primarily used for static content hosting, and it does not provide server-side processing capabilities necessary for dynamic website functionality.

D. Using a geoproximity routing policy in Route 53 would allow you to direct traffic to the on-premises servers based on the geographic location of the users. However, this option does not optimize site loading times for European users as it still requires them to access the website from the on-premises servers in the United States. It does not leverage the benefits of content caching and edge locations for improved performance.

     Option B, would indeed be the most cost-effective solution. Reserved Instances provide cost savings for instances that run consistently, such as the production environment in this case, while On-Demand Instances offer flexibility and are suitable for instances with variable usage patterns like the development and test environments. This combination ensures cost optimization based on the specific requirements and usage patterns described in the question.

"The production EC2 instances run 24 hours a day"
AC are not going to give the 24 hour usage as spot is for intermittent pattern.
D is just normal cost without any discounts for production
B use "reserved" instances so there is an option for discount in billing. On-demand for dev/test is ok as their usage patter doesn't really fall in reserved or spot usage discounts

     The most cost-effective solution for the company's requirements would be to use Spot Instances for the development and test EC2 instances and Reserved Instances for the production EC2 instances.

Spot Instances are a cost-effective choice for non-critical, flexible workloads that can be interrupted. Since the development and test EC2 instances are only needed for at least 8 hours per day and can be stopped when not in use, they would be a good fit for Spot Instances.

       Reserved Instances are a good fit for production EC2 instances that need to run 24 hours a day, as they offer a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instances in exchange for a one-time payment and a commitment to use the instances for a certain period of time.

Option A is the correct answer because it meets the company's requirements for cost-effectively running the development and test EC2 instances and the production EC2 instances.

         Option B is not the most cost-effective solution because it suggests using On-Demand Instances for the development and test EC2 instances, which would be more expensive than using Spot Instances. On-Demand Instances are a good choice for workloads that require a guaranteed capacity and can't be interrupted, but they are more expensive than Spot Instances.

Option C is not the correct solution because Spot blocks are a variant of Spot Instances that offer a guaranteed capacity and duration, but they are not available for all instance types and are not necessarily the most cost-effective option in all cases. In this case, it would be more cost-effective to use Spot Instances for the development and test EC2 instances, as they can be interrupted when not in use.

           Can't use Spot instances for Production environment that needs to run 24/7. That should tell you that Production instances can't have a downtime. Spot instances are used when an application or service can allow disruption and 24/7 production environment won't allow that.

     Reserved instances for 24/7 production instances seems reasonable. By exclusion I will choose the on-demand for dev and test (despite thinking that Spot Flees may be even a better solution from a cost-wise perspective)

     Secrets Manager enables you to replace hardcoded credentials in your code, including passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. This helps ensure the secret can't be compromised by someone examining your code, because the secret no longer exists in the code. Also, you can configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secret for you according to a specified schedule. This enables you to replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, significantly reducing the risk of compromise.

     B. SSM OpsCenter is primarily used for managing and resolving operational issues. It is not designed to securely store and manage credentials like AWS Secrets Manager.

C. Storing credentials in an S3 bucket may provide some level of security, but it lacks the additional features and security controls offered by AWS Secrets Manager.

D. While using KMS for encryption is a good practice, managing credentials directly on the web server file system can introduce complexities and potential security risks. It can be challenging to securely manage and rotate credentials across multiple web servers, especially when considering scalability and automation.

In summary, option A is the recommended solution as it leverages AWS Secrets Manager, which is purpose-built for securely storing and managing secrets, and provides the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access the credentials securely.

     While I agree that A is the most feasible answer, I don't see how it satisfies the "a secure method for the web servers to connect to the database" requirement.  ASM is about securely storing and rotating secrets, but has nothing to do with "secure connection" between the web servers and RDS.  That would require something like IAM DB authentication, which is not even mentioned.

     The correct answer is A.

Here is the explanation:

AWS Secrets Manager is a service that helps you store, manage, and rotate secrets. Secrets Manager is a good choice for storing database user credentials because it is secure and scalable.
IAM permissions can be used to grant web servers access to AWS Secrets Manager. This will allow the web servers to retrieve the database user credentials from Secrets Manager and use them to connect to the database.
Rotation of user credentials can be automated using Secrets Manager. This will ensure that the database user credentials are rotated on a regular basis, meeting the security requirement.

     ***CORRECT***
Option A. Store the database user credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access AWS Secrets Manager.

Option A is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the question: a secure method for the web servers to connect to the database while meeting a security requirement to rotate user credentials frequently. AWS Secrets Manager is designed specifically to store and manage secrets like database credentials, and it provides an automated way to rotate secrets every time they are used, ensuring that the secrets are always fresh and secure. This makes it a good choice for storing and managing the database user credentials in a secure way.

       ***WRONG***
Option B, storing the database user credentials in AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter, is not a good fit for this use case because OpsCenter is a tool for managing and monitoring systems, and it is not designed for storing and managing secrets.

Option C, storing the database user credentials in a secure Amazon S3 bucket, is not a secure option because S3 buckets are not designed to store secrets. While it is possible to store secrets in S3, it is not recommended because S3 is not a secure secrets management service and does not provide the same level of security and automation as AWS Secrets Manager.

         Option D, storing the database user credentials in files encrypted with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) on the web server file system, is not a secure option because it relies on the security of the web server file system, which may not be as secure as a dedicated secrets management service like AWS Secrets Manager. Additionally, this option does not meet the requirement to rotate user credentials frequently because it does not provide an automated way to rotate the credentials.

RDS Proxy minimizes application disruption from outages affecting the availability of your database by automatically connecting to a new database instance while preserving application connections. When failovers occur, RDS Proxy routes requests directly to the new database instance. This reduces failover times for Aurora and RDS databases by up to 66%.

       The original question was about handling a situation where the database is unavailable due to an upgrade, not a failover situation. During a database upgrade, the database instance is not available, and RDS Proxy would not be able to connect to a new database instance because there isn't one.

In this specific scenario, using Amazon SQS as described in option D provides a buffer for the incoming data during the period when the database is unavailable. This ensures that no data is lost, and it can be written to the database once the upgrade is complete.

       Actually RDS Proxy supports Aurora DBs running on PostgreSQL and MySQL.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.RDS_Proxy.html

With RDS proxy, you only expose a single endpoint for request to hit and any failure of the primary DB in a Multi-AZ configuration is will be managed automatically by RDS Proxy to point to the new primary DB. Hence RDS proxy is the most efficient way of solving the issue as additional code change is required.

         The question doesn't say the RDS is deployed in a Mutli-AZ mode. which means RDS is not accessible during upgrade anyway. RDS proxy couldn't resolve the DB HA issue. The question is looking for a solution to store the data during DB upgrade. I don't know RDS proxy very well, but the RDS proxy introduction doesn't mention it has the capability of storing data. So, answer A couldn't store the data created during the DB upgrade. 
I'm assuming this is a bad question design. The expected answer is A, but the question designer missed some important information.

Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure and is engineered to be highly reliable. In the unlikely event of an infrastructure failure, the RDS Proxy endpoint remains online and consistent allowing your application to continue to run database operations.) from the link.

     the answer is D:
This solution ensures that customer data is not lost during database upgrades. The data is stored in the FIFO queue until the database is available again. The new Lambda function can then process the data from the queue and store it in the database. This design provides a buffer for the customer data and decouples the data ingestion from the data processing, increasing the resilience of the system during database upgrades.

     By using Amazon RDS Proxy, you can allow your applications to pool and share database connections to improve their ability to scale. RDS Proxy makes applications more resilient to database failures by automatically connecting to a standby DB instance while preserving application connections. Using RDS Proxy, you can handle unpredictable surges in database traffic. Otherwise, these surges might cause issues due to oversubscribing connections or new connections being created at a fast rate.

     D is the correct answer because it offers storage for the data while the database is updating, using SQS is better than using RDS proxy, because SQS is an independent service and it decouples the system, while RDS proxy might also face some trouble connecting to the database while it's updating.

      Comment:

     My reasoning for selecting D and not A is because while RDS proxy can decouple the lambda-&gt;proxy and proxy-db connections, it cannot hold that beyond the lifetime of the lambda.   If the DB upgrade lasts more than say 15 mins, the lambda will timeout and the data will be lost forever.  The only way to be sure is to use an SQS queue with a retention time that is reasonably longer than the upgrade time, so if the lambda times out, the data will remain in the queue until it is successfully inserted into the DB later and then removed from the queue.

     RDS proxy can improve application availability in such a situation by waiting for the new database instance to be functional and maintaining any requests received from the application during this
time. The end result is that the application is more resilient to issues with the underlying database. This will enable solution to hold data till the time DB comes back to normal.

     Amazon SQS FIFO Queue: Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues provide exactly-once processing, ensuring that messages are processed in the order they are received and are not duplicated. This ensures the reliability of message delivery, crucial for preserving customer data.

Lambda Function to Process Queue: Create a new Lambda function that regularly polls the SQS FIFO queue for messages containing customer data. Lambda can be configured to trigger based on a schedule or on demand. This function will retrieve messages from the queue and process them, storing the customer data in the database.

     RDS proxy is correct 
Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large number of open connections to the database server and may open and close database connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability. With RDS Proxy, failover times for Aurora and RDS databases are reduced by up to 66% and database credentials, authentication, and access can be managed through integration with AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

       What EVERYONE is failing to remember is that when a database is doing an upgrade that ALL instances of the database are offline, whether multi-AZ or read replicas or whatever...these are not 'open' connections, they are failed connections. Where, exactly, would RDS Proxy be proxying to?

     This option introduces a decoupling mechanism using SQS, allowing the Lambda functions to push customer data to a queue during database upgrades. Another Lambda function can then process the queue and store the customer data in the database. This helps to ensure that customer data is not lost during database upgrades, providing a reliable and asynchronous approach to handle such scenarios.

       From Amazon Q: 

RDS Proxy can be used with Amazon Aurora. Here are some key points about using RDS Proxy with Aurora:

RDS Proxy supports connecting to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL databases. This allows applications to connect to Aurora clusters via the proxy.

Using a proxy provides better scalability by allowing connections to be distributed among Aurora replica instances. It also improves availability since the proxy can direct connections to other Aurora replicas if the primary becomes unavailable.

The Aurora database and RDS Proxy must be in the same VPC to allow connections. Your applications can be deployed in the same VPC or a different one, as long as they have network access to the proxy.

Certain regions and Aurora engine versions support RDS Proxy based on the database engine. You can check the AWS documentation for the latest supported versions in each region.

         The database and proxy need appropriate security group rules and IAM permissions configured to allow connections. The RDS Proxy also requires a secret with database credentials stored in Secrets Manager.

You would connect applications to the proxy endpoint rather than directly connecting to the Aurora endpoint. This allows the proxy to handle and load balance connections to the Aurora replicas.

     this question is too vague imho
if the question is looking for a way to incur charges to the European company instead of the US company, then requester pay makes sense.

if they are looking to reduce overall data transfer cost, then B makes sense because the data does not leave the AWS network, thus data transfer cost should be lower technically?

A. makes sense because the US company saves money, but the European company is paying for the charges so there is no overall saving in cost when you look at the big picture

I will go for B because they are not explicitly stating that they want the other company to pay for the charges

       I disagree. The question says, "the company wants to ensure that ITS data transfer costs remain as low as possible" -- 'it' being the US company. The question would have stayed "ensure that data transfer costs" (without the word 'its') if they meant  the overall data transfer cost.

     "Typically, you configure buckets to be Requester Pays buckets when you want to share data but not incur charges associated with others accessing the data. For example, you might use Requester Pays buckets when making available large datasets, such as zip code directories, reference data, geospatial information, or web crawling data."

     Per my understanding, the company is already paying to maintain the data(data keeps growing) in the S3 bucket. The company wants to ensure that its data transfer costs remain as low as possible (implies that it is best if the transfer cost is $0).
As per option A, the requestor would bear the cost of the request and the data downloaded from the bucket, causing the data owner to incur a $0 transfer cost, which is optimal for the data owner.
The question does not say that the data owner must also consider the cost incurred by the requestor and then find an optimal cost solution.

     Correct
A. Configure the Requester Pays feature on the company's S3 bucket.
This feature ensures that the party requesting the data pays for the data transfer costs instead of the bucket owner.

Incorrect
B. Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication from the company's S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets. Cross-Region Replication incurs additional storage and transfer costs as data is replicated across regions. This would increase costs rather than reduce them.

     In this setup, anyone who requests data from the S3 bucket must cover the cost of the data transfer and request charges. This approach is ideal for S3 bucket owners who share large datasets with other users or organizations and want to avoid bearing the cost of data transfer. This would be the most direct way to ensure that the survey company's data transfer costs remain minimal while sharing data with the European marketing firm. The marketing firm, as the requester, will pay for the data they access or transfer.

     Versioning will keep multiple variants of an object in case one is accidentally or intentionally deleted - the previous versions can still be restored.

MFA Delete requires additional authentication to permanently delete an object version. This prevents accidental deletion

     B. Enabling MFA on the IAM user credentials adds an extra layer of security to the user authentication process. However, it does not specifically address the concern of accidental deletion of documents in the S3 bucket.

C. Adding an S3 Lifecycle policy to deny the delete action during audit dates would prevent intentional deletions during specific time periods. However, it does not address accidental deletions that can occur at any time.

D. Using KMS for encryption and restricting access to the KMS key provides additional security for the data stored in the S3 . However, it does not directly prevent accidental deletion of documents in the S3.

Enabling versioning and MFA Delete on the S3 (option A) is the most appropriate solution for securing the audit documents. Versioning ensures that multiple versions of the documents are stored, allowing for easy recovery in case of accidental deletions. Enabling MFA Delete requires the use of multi-factor authentication to authorize deletion actions, adding an extra layer of protection against unintended deletions.

     The solution architect should do Option A: Enable the versioning and MFA Delete features on the S3 bucket.

This will secure the audit documents by providing an additional layer of protection against accidental deletion. With versioning enabled, any deleted or overwritten objects in the S3 bucket will be preserved as previous versions, allowing the company to recover them if needed. With MFA Delete enabled, any delete request made to the S3 bucket will require the use of an MFA code, which provides an additional layer of security.

       Option B: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the IAM user credentials for each audit team IAM user account, would not provide protection against accidental deletion. 

Option C: Adding an S3 Lifecycle policy to the audit team's IAM user accounts to deny the s3:DeleteObject action during audit dates, which would not provide protection against accidental deletion outside of the specified audit dates. 

Option D: Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the S3 bucket and restrict audit team IAM user accounts from accessing the KMS key, would not provide protection against accidental deletion.

     • You have a production DB that is taking on a normal load
	• You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
	• You create a read replica to run the new workload there
	• The prod application is unaffected
	• Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements
Therefore I believe B to be the better answer.

As for "D" - ElastiCache use cases are:
1. Your data is slow or expensive to get when compared to cache retrieval.
2. Users access your data often.
3. Your data stays relatively the same, or if it changes quickly staleness is not a large issue.

1 - Somewhat true.
2 - Not true for our case.
3 - Also not true. The data changes throughout the day.

For my understanding, caching has to do with millisecond results, high-performance reads. These are not the issues mentioned in the questions, therefore B.

     A. Having multi-AZ database would increase availability, bu not performance.
C. Not practical. Huge Operational Overhead. (Solution should be LEAST operational overhead)
D. Good for fixed queries with fixed results. not a good fit in this case as script is looking for new results in DB. It has to scan the database.

Correct Answer B. Read replica ensure you have dedicated read instance with its own resources.

We will exclude answer D because question is about RDS databases and ElastiCache is not.

       Doesn't it become a multi-instance DB when you add a read replica? A can't be because you can't read from the passive replica of a multi-AZ DB.

     - Cached data might not always be up-to-date, so you need to manage cache expiry and invalidation carefully.
- It may require some code changes to implement caching logic in your script.
- ElastiCache comes with additional costs, so you should assess the cost implications based on your usage.

     Why not D:
While ElastiCache can be relatively easy to set up, it still requires ongoing management, monitoring, and potentially scaling as the dataset and query load grow. This introduces operational overhead that may not align with the goal of minimizing operational work.

Resolve the issue of inadequate database performance for development tasks when the script is running
With the least operational overhead

     A. Modifying the DB to be a Multi-AZ deployment improves high availability and fault tolerance but does not directly address the performance issue during the script execution.

C. Instructing the development team to manually export the entries in the database introduces manual effort and is not a scalable or efficient solution.

D. While using ElastiCache for caching can improve read performance for common queries, it may not be the most suitable solution for the scenario described. Caching is effective for reducing the load on the database for frequently accessed data, but it may not directly address the performance issue during the script execution.

Creating a read replica of the database (option B) provides a scalable solution that offloads read traffic from the primary database. The script can be configured to query the read replica, reducing the impact on the primary database during the script execution.

     Gateway endpoints provide reliable connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB without requiring an internet gateway or a NAT device for your VPC. It should be option A.

     ***CORRECT***
The correct solution is Option A (Configure an S3 gateway endpoint.)

A gateway endpoint is a VPC endpoint that you can use to connect to Amazon S3 from within your VPC. Traffic between your VPC and Amazon S3 never leaves the Amazon network, so it doesn't traverse the internet. This means you can access Amazon S3 without the need to use a NAT gateway or a VPN connection.

***WRONG***
Option B (creating an S3 bucket in a private subnet) is not a valid solution because S3 buckets do not have subnets.

Option C (creating an S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the EC2 instances) is not a requirement for meeting the given security regulations.

Option D (configuring a NAT gateway in the same subnet as the EC2 instances) is not a valid solution because it would allow traffic to leave the VPC and travel across the Internet.

     A. Configure an S3 gateway endpoint.
Correct: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html
With a gateway endpoint, you can access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC.
Additional you need to configure the route table for the subnet that EC2 stays, but we have the key word here.

B. Create an S3 bucket in a private subnet.
I am not aware that we can create S3 bucket in certain subnet.

C. Create an S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the EC2 instances.
Not enough. Without VPC gateway endpoint, access will through go out to the internet.

D. Configure a NAT gateway in the same subnet as the EC2 instances.
NAT gateway outbound traffic should also go out to the internet.

     You can access Amazon S3 from your VPC using gateway VPC endpoints. After you create the gateway endpoint, you can add it as a target in your route table for traffic destined from your VPC to Amazon S3.

There is no additional charge for using gateway endpoints.

Amazon S3 supports both gateway endpoints and interface endpoints. With a gateway endpoint, you can access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC, and with no additional cost. However, gateway endpoints do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway. For those scenarios, you must use an interface endpoint, which is available for an additional cost.

     B. Creating an S3 in a private subnet restricts direct internet access to the bucket but does not provide a direct and secure connection between the EC2and the S3. The application would still need to traverse the internet to access the S3 API.

C. Creating an S3 in the same Region as the EC2 does not inherently prevent traffic from traversing the internet.

D. Configuring a NAT gateway allows outbound internet connectivity for resources in private subnets, but it does not provide a direct and secure connection to the S3 service. The traffic from the EC2 to the S3 API would still traverse the internet.

The most suitable solution is to configure an S3 gateway endpoint (option A). It provides a secure and private connection between the VPC and the S3 service without requiring the traffic to traverse the internet. With an S3 gateway endpoint, the EC2 can access the S3 API directly within the VPC, meeting the security requirement of preventing traffic from traveling across the internet.

     The key requirements are to provide secure access to the S3 bucket only from the application tier EC2 instances inside the VPC.

A VPC gateway endpoint allows private access to S3 from within the VPC without needing internet access. This keeps the traffic secure within the AWS network.

The bucket policy should limit access to only the application tier, not make the objects public. This restricts access to the sensitive data to only the authorized application tier.

     A. This eliminates the need for the traffic to go over the internet, providing an added layer of security.

B. It is important to restrict access to the bucket and its objects only to authorized entities.

C.  This helps maintain the confidentiality of the sensitive user information by limiting access to authorized resources.

D. In this case, since the EC2 instances are accessing the S3 bucket from within the VPC, using IAM user credentials is unnecessary and can introduce additional security risks.

E.  a NAT instance to access the S3 bucket adds unnecessary complexity and overhead.

In summary, the recommended steps to provide secure access to the S3 from the application tier running on EC2 inside a VPC are to configure a VPC gateway endpoint for S3 within the VPC (option A) and create a bucket policy that limits access to only the application tier running in the VPC (option C).

     The recommended solution is Option B: Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand.

To alleviate the application latency issue, the recommended solution is to use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production, and use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand. This allows the development team to continue using the staging environment without delay, while also providing elasticity and availability for the production application.

Therefore, Options A, C, and D are not recommended

       Agree, solution it seems to be the B)
1) Because the company wants "elasticity and availability" as the question mentioned, so I think this leaves us in the two questions related to Aurora discarding the RDS Mysql solution.
2) Accoding AWS documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Clone.html)
"Aurora cloning is especially useful for quickly setting up test environments using your production data, without risking data corruption"

       Option A: Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Populating the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility is not the recommended solution because it involves taking a full export of the production database, which can cause unacceptable application latency.

Option C: Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Using the standby instance for the staging database is not the recommended solution because it does not give the development team the ability to continue using the staging environment without delay. The standby instance is used for failover in case of a production instance failure, and it is not intended for use as a staging environment.

     Answer B:
Few Points about Aurora Database Cloning:
• Create a new Aurora DB Cluster from an existing one
• Faster than snapshot &amp; restore
• Uses copy-on-write protocol
• Very fast &amp; cost-effective
• Useful to create a “staging” database from a “production” database without impacting the production database

     Option B is the best solution that meets all the requirements:

Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand.

The key requirements are to:

Alleviate application latency caused by database exports
Give development immediate access to a staging environment
Aurora Multi-AZ replicas improves availability and provides fast failover.

Database cloning creates an instantly available copy of the production database that can be used for staging. This avoids any export or restoration del

     A. Populating the staging database through a backup and restore process using the mysqldump utility would still result in delays and impact application latency.

B. With Aurora, you can create a clone of the production database quickly and efficiently, without the need for time-consuming backup and restore processes. The development team can spin up the staging database on-demand, eliminating delays and allowing them to continue using the staging environment without interruption.

C. Using the standby instance for the staging database would not provide the development team with the ability to use the staging environment without delay. The standby instance is designed for failover purposes and may not be readily available for immediate use.

D. Relying on a backup and restore process using the mysqldump utility would still introduce delays and impact application latency during the data population phase.

     With Amazon Aurora MySQL, creating a staging database using database cloning is an easy process. Using database cloning will eliminate the performance issues that occur when a full export is done, and the new database is created. In addition, Amazon Aurora's high availability is provided through Multi-AZ deployment, and read replicas can be used to serve the heavy read traffic without affecting the production database. This solution provides better scalability, elasticity, and availability than the current architecture.

       In a RDS Multi-AZ deployment, you can use the standby instance for read-only purposes, such as running queries and reporting. This is known as a "read replica." You can create one or more read replicas of a DB instance and use them to offload read traffic from the primary instance.

     A. Configuring EMR and an Aurora DB cluster for this use case would introduce unnecessary complexity and operational overhead. EMR is typically used for processing large datasets and running big data frameworks like Apache Spark or Hadoop.

B. While using S3 event notifications and SQS for decoupling is a good approach, using EC2 to process the data would introduce operational overhead in terms of managing and scaling the EC2.

D. Using EventBridge and Kinesis Data Streams for this use case would introduce additional complexity and operational overhead compared to the other options. EventBridge and Kinesis are typically used for real-time streaming and processing of large volumes of data.

In summary, option C is the recommended solution as it provides a serverless and scalable approach for processing uploaded files using S3 event notifications, SQS, and Lambda. It offers low operational overhead, automatic scaling, and efficient handling of varying demand. Storing the resulting JSON file in DynamoDB aligns with the requirement of saving the data for later analysis.

     Option C, Configuring Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue and using an AWS Lambda function to read from the queue and process the data, would likely be the solution with the least operational overhead.

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without the need to provision or manage infrastructure. When a new file is uploaded to Amazon S3, it can trigger an event notification which sends a message to an SQS queue. The Lambda function can then be set up to be triggered by messages in the queue, and it can process the data and store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.

       Using a serverless solution like AWS Lambda can help to reduce operational overhead because it automatically scales to meet demand and does not require you to provision and manage infrastructure. Additionally, using an SQS queue as a buffer between the S3 event notification and the Lambda function can help to decouple the processing of the data from the uploading of the data, allowing the processing to happen asynchronously and improving the overall efficiency of the system.

     The solutions architect should recommend option D: Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database.

Creating read replicas allows the application to offload read traffic from the source database, improving its performance. The read replicas should be configured with the same compute and storage resources as the source database to ensure that they can handle the read workload effectively.

Correct Answer is D: Read replica with same compute power as source database instance.

     In a Multi-AZ deployment, the standby instance is kept in sync with the primary instance and is used for failover purposes only. You cannot read data from the standby instance in a Multi-AZ deployment. If you need to offload read traffic from the primary instance, you can create one or more Read Replicas. Read Replicas are read-only copies of your database that can be used to offload read traffic from the primary instance, which can help improve performance

     Both B and D would work.

Amazon RDS now offers Multi-AZ deployments with readable standby instances (also called Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments) . You should consider using Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments with two readable DB instances if you need additional read capacity in your Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment and if your application workload has strict transaction latency requirements such as single-digit milliseconds transactions.

     The best solution is to create read replicas for the database and configure them with the same compute and storage resources as the source database.

The key requirements are to quickly optimize performance by isolating reads from writes.

Read replicas allow read-only workloads to be directed to one or more replicas of the source RDS instance. This separates reporting or analytics queries from transactional workloads.

The read replicas should have the same compute and storage as the source to provide equivalent performance for reads. Scaling down the replicas would limit read performance.

Using Multi-AZ alone does not achieve read/write separation. The secondary AZ instance is for disaster recovery, not performance.

     A. In a Multi-AZ deployment, a standby replica of the database is created in a different AZ for high availability and automatic failover purposes. However, serving read requests from the primary AZ alone would not effectively separate read and write traffic. Both read and write traffic would still be directed to the primary database instance, which might not fully optimize performance.

B. The secondary instance in a Multi-AZ deployment is intended for failover and backup purposes, not for actively serving read traffic. It operates in a standby mode and is not optimized for handling read queries efficiently.

C. Configuring the read replicas with half of the compute and storage resources as the source database might not be optimal. It's generally recommended to configure the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database to ensure they can handle the read workload effectively.

D. Configuring the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database ensures that they can handle the read workload efficiently and provide the required performance boost.

       CHATGPT says:

To optimize the application's performance and separate read traffic from write traffic, the solutions architect should recommend creating read replicas for the database and configuring them to serve read requests. Option C and D both suggest creating read replicas, but option D is a better choice because it configures the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database.

Option A and B suggest changing the existing database to a Multi-AZ deployment, which would provide high availability by replicating the database across multiple Availability Zones. However, it would not separate read and write traffic, so it is not the best solution for optimizing application performance in this scenario.

       Multi-AZ: Synchronous replication occurs, meaning that synchronizing data between DB instances immediately can slow down application's performance. But this method increases High Availability.
Read Replicas: Asynchronous replication occurs, meaning that replicating data in other moments rather than in the writing will maintain application's performance. Although the data won't be HA as Multi-AZ kind of deployment, this method increases Scalability. Good for read heavy workloads.

     You can create up to 15 read replicas from one DB instance within the same Region. For replication to operate effectively, each read replica should have the same amount of compute and storage resources as the source DB instance. If you scale the source DB instance, also scale the read replicas.

     What the policy means:
1. Allow termination of any instance if user's source IP address is 100.100.254.
2. Deny termination of instances that are not in the us-east-1 Combining this two, you get:
“Allow instance termination in the us-east-1 region if the user's source IP address is 10.100.100.254. Deny termination operation on other regions.”

     C is correct.
0.0/24 , the following five IP addresses are reserved:
0.0: Network address.
0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
0.2: Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is the base of the VPC network range plus two. ...
0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
0.255: Network broadcast address.

     The first rule allows users with the specified IP CIDR to terminate instances, and the second rule specifies that the region must be us-east-1 for the termination process to be allowed, hence C is the correct answer.

     D. Users cannot terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254.

This option corresponds to the second statement in the policy, where all EC2 actions in the "us-east-1" region are denied permission when the user's source IP is "10.100.100.254".

     Here is how I interpreted this
first part: terminate instance is allowed for the given CIDR block
second part: deny all ec2 actions when region is not us-east-1

so second part is like double negative which means allow for us-east-1 region

You combine both (remember deny always take priority which is why this is written in double negative) and you get:
[allow us-east-region1 to do any action on ec2] when [action is terminate instance and CIDR block is match]
so C is the answer
D is there to confuse you with the double negative

     Deny takes precedence over Allow. Thus the flow is as follows:

IF region of the EC2 instance is not "us-east-1" -&gt; Deny
ELSE if request is coming from 10.100.100.0/24 -&gt; Allow
ELSE: implicit deny (what is not allowed is denied)

     if
IP = 10.100.100.0/24

Deny EC2 termination permission

     The first statement allows users to terminate EC2 instances (ec2:TerminateInstances) from any IP address within the range 10.100.100.0/24.
The second statement denies users the ability to perform any EC2 actions (ec2:*) in any region other than us-east-1.
So, the correct interpretation is:

D. Users cannot terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254

     I went for C for obvious reasons

Wondering though; this policy also allows to terminate EC2 instances in US-east-1 even if your source IP is not the 10.100.100.254, right? 
The idea is that since I do not deny this for the other source IP addresses, the Allow action is a obsolete?

     D. Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system on AWS and set the Active Directory domain for authentication.

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed file storage service that is designed to be used with Microsoft Windows workloads. It is integrated with Active Directory for access control and is highly available, as it stores data across multiple availability zones. Additionally, FSx can be used to migrate data from on-premises Microsoft Windows file servers to the AWS Cloud. This makes it a good fit for the requirements described in the question.

     A. EFS does not provide native integration with AD for access control. While you can configure EFS to work with AD, it requires additional setup and is not as straightforward as using a dedicated Windows file system like FSx for Windows File Server.

B. It may introduce additional complexity for this use case. Creating an SMB file share using AWS Storage Gateway would require maintaining the gateway and managing the synchronization between on-premises and AWS storage.

C. S3 does not natively provide the SMB file protocol required for MS SharePoint and Windows shared file storage. While it is possible to mount an S3 as a volume using 3rd-party tools or configurations, it is not the recommended.

D. FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed, highly available file storage service that is compatible with MSWindows shared file storage requirements. It provides native integration with AD, allowing for seamless access control and authentication using existing AD user accounts.

     One solution that can satisfy the mentioned requirements is to use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Amazon FSx is a fully managed service that provides highly available and scalable file storage for Windows-based applications. It is designed to be fully integrated with Active Directory, which allows you to use your existing domain users and groups to control access to your file shares.

Amazon FSx provides the ability to migrate data from on-premises file servers to the cloud, using tools like AWS DataSync, Robocopy or PowerShell. Once the data is migrated, you can continue to use the same tools and processes to manage and access the file shares as you would on-premises.

Amazon FSx also provides features such as automatic backups, data encryption, and native multi-Availability Zone (AZ) deployments for high availability. It can be easily integrated with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and AWS Backup, for additional functionality and backup options.

     Sorry, but I disagree with everyone. The question states "a gaming application that is hosted in an on-premises data center". Option D does not address this and cannot to my knowledge address it. Thus:

A. Create an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Create a file share that uses the required client protocol. Connect the application server to the file share.

By using AWS Storage Gateway in file gateway mode, you can extend your on-premises data center storage into the AWS cloud. The file share created on AWS Storage Gateway can use the necessary client protocol (such as Lustre), which would allow the Lustre clients in your on-premises data center to access the data stored on AWS Storage Gateway.

This solution enables you to use Lustre clients to access data, while still keeping the gaming application hosted in your on-premises data center. AWS Storage Gateway provides a fully managed solution for this hybrid scenario, allowing seamless integration between on-premises and AWS cloud storage.

     A. Lustre client access is not supported by AWS Storage Gateway file gateway.

B. Creating a Windows file share on an EC2 Windows instance is suitable for Windows-based file sharing, but it does not provide the required Lustre client access. Lustre is a high-performance parallel file system primarily used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

C. EFS does not natively support Lustre client access. Although EFS is a managed file storage service, it is designed for general-purpose file storage and is not optimized for Lustre workloads.

D. Amazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed file system optimized for high-performance computing workloads, including Lustre clients. It provides the ability to use Lustre clients to access data in a managed and scalable manner. By choosing this option, the company can benefit from the performance and manageability of Amazon FSx for Lustre while meeting the requirement of Lustre client access.

     D is the most logical solution. But still the app is OnPrem so AWS Fx for Lustre is not enough to connect the storage to the app, we'll need a File Gateway to use with the FSx Lustre

         EBS also has Multi-AZ capability, but it does not replicate the data across multiple availability zones by default. When Multi-AZ is enabled, it creates a replica of the EBS volume in a different availability zone and automatically failover to the replica in case of a failure. However, this requires additional configuration and management. In comparison, Amazon S3 automatically replicates data across multiple availability zones without any additional configuration. Therefore, storing the data on Amazon S3 provides a simpler and more efficient solution for high availability.

           This is false. There is no AWS-provided functionality that will replicate EBS volumes across AZs. There are 3rd-party solutions to this, but that's not what's being asked here.

     AWS KMS: Provides a managed service for secure key storage and encryption/decryption operations. This eliminates the need to manage encryption/decryption logic within the application itself.
Customer Managed Key: The company maintains control over the key, ensuring security.
EC2 Role Permissions: Granting permissions to the EC2 role allows the application to use KMS for encryption/decryption without managing individual credentials.
Amazon S3: Offers highly available and scalable storage for the encrypted certificates. S3 is generally cheaper than EBS for data that is not frequently accessed.

     I would select D.
you can mount a single Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume to multiple Docker containers running on the same Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance.
.
you can store data from a container running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. One way to do this is to use the aws s3 cp command in the command line of the EC2 instance.

     A is OK
secrets manager:
	- is highly available
	- you can store custom secrets in it like certificate
	- automatically encrypts secrets at rest, and can be configured for encryption in transit
	- downloading certificate from it is less operational overhead than decrypting it manually with KMS key

arguments againts it that this is more manual than C and D? this manual step is necessary measure and can't be omitted in other options
C and D have this "store the encrypted data in..." to store encrypted certificate you have to: log in to instance, get kms key, get certificate, encrypt it, and load that data this is more operational overhead

       "Least operational overhead" and "manually" (as in A) usually don't go together. Also, A does not say anything about storing the data (which is a requirement).

"C and D have this 'store the encrypted data in'" yes, exactly, the encrypted data, NOT the certificate. You encrypt data with the certificate, and you want to store THAT encrypted data.

     "C" is more correct because S3 is more efficient and cheaper to store data like certificates, like this case. Also Option D involves using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes, which is not typically used for storing certificates and may introduce unnecessary complexity and operational overhead.

     C. when it comes to availability, Amazon S3 is generally more highly available than Amazon EBS because S3 replicates data across multiple AZs by default, providing greater resilience to failures. However, the choice between S3 and EBS depends on your specific use case and whether you need block storage for EC2 instances (EBS) or object storage for storing and retrieving data (S3).

     Option C is the best solution that meets all the requirements with the least operational overhead:

Use AWS KMS customer managed key for encryption
Allow EC2 instance role access to use the KMS key
Store encrypted data in Amazon S3

     All data within EBS is stored in equally sized blocks. This system offers some performance advantages over traditional storage, and generally boasts lower latency, too. This would meet the near real time requirement over the S3 option

     The correct answer is option A.

To enable Internet access for the private subnets, the solutions architect should create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each Availability Zone (AZ). NAT gateways allow private instances to initiate outbound traffic to the Internet but do not allow inbound traffic from the Internet to reach the private instances.

The solutions architect should then create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ. This will allow instances in the private subnets to access the Internet through the NAT gateways in the public subnets.

       But in AWS a NAT GW is attached to a subnet, and a subnet resides in a single AZ. Can't create multi-AZ NAT GW without changing whole architecture. You CAN use one NAT GW from multiple subnets in multiple AZs I think, but then it would not be HA.

     The best solution is to create a NAT gateway in each public subnet (one per availability zone), and update the route tables for the private subnets to send internet traffic to the NAT gateway.

NAT gateways allow private subnets to access the internet for things like software updates, without exposing those instances directly to the internet. An egress-only internet gateway would allow outbound access, but also allow inbound internet traffic, which is not desired for the private subnets.

     "Egress" means outbound connection, remove D. "Second gateway", remove C. 

Now has only A and B. The different between A versus B is "1 NAT gateway, 1 for public subnet in each AZ" (A) and "1 NAT gateway, 1 for private subnet in each AZ" (B).

Choose A.

      Comment:

     By creating a NAT gateway in each public subnet, the private subnets can route their Internet-bound traffic through the NAT gateways. This allows EC2 in the private subnets to download software updates and access other resources on the Internet.

Additionally, a separate private route table should be created for each AZ. The private route tables should have a default route that forwards non-VPC traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the corresponding NAT gateway in the same AZ. This ensures that the private subnets use the appropriate NAT gateway for Internet access.

B is incorrect because NAT instances require manual management and configuration compared to NAT gateways, which are a fully managed service. NAT instances are also being deprecated in favor of NAT gateways.

C is incorrect because creating a second internet gateway on a private subnet is not a valid solution. Internet gateways are associated with public subnets and cannot be directly associated with private subnets.

D is incorrect because egress-only internet gateways are used for IPv6 traffic.

     Answer and HOW-TO

B. Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.
E. Use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server.

To automate the process of transferring the data from the on-premises SFTP server to an EC2 instance with an EFS file system, you can use AWS DataSync. AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates transferring data between on-premises storage systems and Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

To use AWS DataSync for this task, you should first install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center. This agent is a lightweight software application that you install on your on-premises data source. The agent communicates with the AWS DataSync service to transfer data between the data source and target locations.

       Next, you should use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server. A location represents a data source or a data destination in an AWS DataSync task. You can create a location for the on-premises SFTP server by specifying the IP address, the path to the data, and the necessary credentials to access the data.

Once you have created the location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server, you can use AWS DataSync to transfer the data to the EC2 instance with the EFS file system. AWS DataSync handles the data transfer process automatically and efficiently, transferring the data at high speeds and minimizing downtime.

         Explanation of other options

A. Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.

This option is not wrong, but it is not directly related to automating the process of transferring the data from the on-premises SFTP server to the EC2 instance with the EFS file system. Launching the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system can improve the performance and reliability of the file system, as it reduces the latency between the EC2 instance and the file system. However, it is not necessary for automating the data transfer process.

           C. Create a secondary Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instance for the data.

This option is incorrect because Amazon EBS is a block-level storage service that is designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances. It is not suitable for storing large amounts of data that need to be accessed by multiple EC2 instances, like in the case of the NFS-based file system on the on-premises SFTP server. Instead, you should use Amazon EFS, which is a fully managed, scalable, and distributed file system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances concurrently.

             D. Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data to the EC2 instance.

This option is not wrong, but it is not the most efficient or automated way to transfer the data from the on-premises SFTP server to the EC2 instance with the EFS file system. Manually transferring the data using an operating system copy command would require manual intervention and would not scale well for large amounts of data. It would also not provide the same level of performance and reliability as a fully managed service like AWS DataSync.

     **A**. Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.
Makes sense to have the instance in the same AZ the EFS storage is.
**B**. Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.
The DataSync with move the data to the EFS, which already uses the EC2 instance (see the info provided). No more things are required...
C. Create a secondary Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instance for the data.
This secondary EBS volume isn't required... the data should be move on to EFS...
D. Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data to the EC2 instance.
Potentially possible (instead of A), BUT the "automate this task" premise goes against any "manually" action. So, we should keep A.
E. Use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server.
I don't get the relationship between DataSync and the configuration for SFTP "on-prem"! Nonsense.
So, anwers are A&amp;B

       Just go to AWS Console, to DataSync and choose "Create Location Configuration". Locations configurations are endpoints used in DataSync task. A location can be the source endpoint of the task, e.g. a NFS on-premise filesystem. So E is helping in the automation process. A is not even part of this automation process, it is a solution already agreed to have EC2 with EFS, how you connect EC2 to EFS is not part of the solution!

         Use AWS Transfer Family instead of DataSync for SFTP. So E seems incorrect.

When do I use AWS DataSync and when do I use AWS Transfer Family?

A: If you currently use SFTP to exchange data with third parties, AWS Transfer Family provides a fully managed SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and AS2 transfer directly into and out of Amazon S3, while reducing your operational burden.

If you want an accelerated and automated data transfer between NFS servers, SMB file shares, Hadoop clusters, self-managed or cloud object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and Amazon FSx, you can use AWS DataSync. DataSync is ideal for customers who need online migrations for active data sets, timely transfers for continuously generated data, or replication for business continuity.

     The most appropriate combination of steps to automate the task of migrating the on-premises SFTP server to an Amazon EC2 instance using Amazon EFS is:

A. Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.
E. Use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server.

Explanation:

A. Launching the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system ensures optimal performance and low-latency access to the file system.

E. AWS DataSync can be used to automate and accelerate the transfer of data between on-premises systems and AWS. Creating a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server with AWS DataSync facilitates the migration process.

Therefore, options A and E together provide an efficient and automated approach to migrate the data.

     Apparently it's not B, as it says: 
"Install" an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.
You actually don't install it.
You deploy it as a vm or EC2.
So I guess it's the terminology that hints at "E"

     This is the purpose of bookmarks: "AWS Glue tracks data that has already been processed during a previous run of an ETL job by persisting state information from the job run. This persisted state information is called a job bookmark. Job bookmarks help AWS Glue maintain state information and prevent the reprocessing of old data."

     A. Job bookmarks in Glue allow you to track the last-processed data in a job. By enabling job bookmarks, Glue keeps track of the processed data and automatically resumes processing from where it left off in subsequent job runs.

B. Results in the permanent removal of the data from the S3, making it unavailable for future job runs. This is not desirable if the data needs to be retained or used for subsequent analysis.

C.It would only affect the parallelism of the job but would not address the issue of reprocessing old data. It does not provide a mechanism to track the processed data or skip already processed data.

D. It is not directly related to preventing Glue from reprocessing old data. The FindMatches transform is used for identifying and matching duplicate or matching records in a dataset. While it can be used in data processing pipelines, it does not address the specific requirement of avoiding reprocessing old data in this scenario.

     The best solution is to edit the AWS Glue job to use job bookmarks.

Job bookmarks allow AWS Glue ETL jobs to track which data has already been processed during previous runs. This prevents reprocessing of old data.

Deleting the data after processing would cause the data to be lost and unavailable for future processing. Reducing the number of workers may improve performance but does not prevent reprocessing of old data. Using a FindMatches ML transform is used for record matching, not preventing reprocessing.

So the solutions architect should enable job bookmarks in the AWS Glue job configuration. This will allow the ETL job to keep track of processed data and only transform the new data added since the last run.

     Job bookmarks are used in AWS Glue ETL jobs to keep track of the data that has already been processed in a previous job run. With bookmarks enabled, AWS Glue will read the bookmark information from the previous job run and will only process the new data that has been added to the data source since the last job run. This saves time and reduces costs by eliminating the need to reprocess old data.

Therefore, a solutions architect should edit the AWS Glue ETL job to use job bookmarks so that it will only process new data added to the S3 bucket since the last job run.

     Job bookmarks enable AWS Glue to track the data that has been processed in a previous run of the job.

     Option A. Edit the job to use job bookmarks.

Job bookmarks in AWS Glue allow the ETL job to track the data that has been processed and to skip data that has already been processed. This can prevent AWS Glue from reprocessing old data and can improve the performance of the ETL job by only processing new data. To use job bookmarks, the solutions architect can edit the job and set the "Use job bookmark" option to "True". The ETL job will then use the job bookmark to track the data that has been processed and skip data that has already been processed in subsequent runs.

     Option A. Use AWS Shield Advanced to stop the DDoS attack.

It provides always-on protection for Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, and Amazon Route 53 resources. By using AWS Shield Advanced, the solutions architect can help protect the website from large-scale DDoS attacks.

Option C. Configure the website to use Amazon CloudFront for both static and dynamic content.

CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that integrates with other Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2, to deliver content to users with low latency and high data transfer speeds. By using CloudFront, the solutions architect can distribute the website's content across multiple edge locations, which can help absorb the impact of a DDoS attack and reduce the risk of downtime for the website.

     CoPilot - "No, you do not need Amazon CloudFront to implement AWS Shield Advanced. AWS Shield Advanced provides protection for several AWS services, including Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 resources, in addition to CloudFront distributions1. It's designed to offer more sophisticated protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, regardless of the AWS service being used1. However, it's important to note that while CloudFront is not a requirement, using AWS Shield Advanced with CloudFront can enhance your application's security by providing additional DDoS protection."

     A. AWS Shield Advanced provides advanced DDoS protection for AWS resources, including EC2. It includes features such as real-time threat intelligence, automatic protection, and DDoS cost protection.

C. CloudFront is a CDN service that can help mitigate DDoS attacks. By routing traffic through CloudFront, requests to the website are distributed across multiple edge locations, which can absorb and mitigate DDoS attacks more effectively. CloudFront also provides additional DDoS protection features, such as rate limiting, SSL/TLS termination, and custom security policies.

B. While GuardDuty can detect and provide insights into potential malicious activity, it is not specifically designed for DDoS mitigation.

D. Network ACLs are not designed to handle high-volume traffic or DDoS attacks efficiently.

E. Spot Instances are a cost optimization strategy and may not provide the necessary availability and protection against DDoS attacks compared to using dedicated instances with DDoS protection mechanisms like Shield Advanced and CloudFront.

     The correct solution is D. Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and Service: events.amazonaws.com as the principal.

The principle of least privilege requires that permissions are granted only to the minimum necessary to perform a task. In this case, the Lambda function needs to be able to be invoked by Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events). To meet these requirements, you can add a resource-based policy to the function that allows the InvokeFunction action to be performed by the Service: events.amazonaws.com principal. This will allow Amazon EventBridge to invoke the function, but will not grant any additional permissions to the function.

       Why other options are wrong

Option A is incorrect because it grants the lambda:InvokeFunction action to any principal (*), which would allow any entity to invoke the function and goes beyond the minimum permissions needed.

Option B is incorrect because it grants the lambda:InvokeFunction action to the Service: lambda.amazonaws.com principal, which would allow any Lambda function to invoke the function and goes beyond the minimum permissions needed.

Option C is incorrect because it grants the lambda:* action to the Service: events.amazonaws.com principal, which would allow Amazon EventBridge to perform any action on the function and goes beyond the minimum permissions needed.

     Following the principle of least privilege, you should not grant Events the * privilege. Just enough to perform its job will do.

Also, you need a resource-based policy to attach to the function, for Events to be able to execute the function

     Good explanation from ChatGPT:

In order to adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring permissions for an AWS Lambda function invoked by an Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule, the most appropriate solution would be:

D. Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and Service: events.amazonaws.com as the principal.

This solution involves attaching a resource-based policy to the Lambda function. It specifies that the only entity allowed to invoke the Lambda function is the Amazon EventBridge service (represented by the principal events.amazonaws.com) and restricts the action to only invoking the function (lambda:InvokeFunction). This aligns with the principle of least privilege by granting the necessary permissions explicitly to the service that needs them, without providing overly permissive access.

     Is anyone can explain why B is can't be a good choice? The option adds the execution role to the function, with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and Service: lambda.amazonaws.com as the body. This restricts the Lambda function to only the Lambda service, providing an effective layer of security. and fully complies with the principle of least privilege

     lambda:InvokeFunction is the action needed to invoke the Lambda function.
Service: events.amazonaws.com is the principal (the AWS service) that is allowed to invoke the Lambda function. In this case, you're explicitly allowing CloudWatch Events to invoke the function.

     In this solution, a resource-based policy is added to the Lambda function, which allows the specified principal (events.amazonaws.com) to invoke the function. The lambda:InvokeFunction action provides the necessary permission for the Amazon EventBridge rule to trigger the Lambda function.

Option A is incorrect because it assigns the lambda:InvokeFunction action to all principals (*), which grants permission to invoke the function to any entity, which is broader than necessary.

Option B is incorrect because it assigns the lambda:InvokeFunction action to the specific principal "lambda.amazonaws.com," which is the service principal for AWS Lambda. However, the requirement is for the EventBridge service principal to invoke the function.

Option C is incorrect because it assigns the lambda:* action to the specific principal "events.amazonaws.com," which is the service principal for Amazon EventBridge. However, it grants broader permissions than necessary, allowing any Lambda function action, not just lambda:InvokeFunction.

     SSE-KMS provides a secure and efficient way to encrypt data at rest in S3. SSE-KMS uses KMS to manage the encryption keys securely. With SSE-KMS, encryption keys can be automatically rotated using KMS key rotation feature, which simplifies the key management process and ensures compliance with the requirement to rotate keys every year.

Additionally, SSE-KMS provides built-in audit logging for encryption key usage through CloudTrail, which captures API calls related to the management and usage of KMS keys. This meets the requirement for logging key usage for auditing purposes.

Option A (SSE-C) requires customers to provide their own encryption keys, but it does not provide key rotation or built-in logging of key usage.
Option B (SSE-S3) uses Amazon S3 managed keys for encryption, which simplifies key management but does not provide key rotation or detailed key usage logging.
Option C (SSE-KMS with manual rotation) uses AWS KMS keys but requires manual rotation, which is less operationally efficient than the automatic key rotation available with option D.

Hence Possible answer is Option C or D. Now mentioned in the requirement that key rotation solution must be automated. So Option C is not the correct answer.
Correct Answer: D - SSE with KMS which support automatic key rotation.

     The correct answer is D. Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) with automatic rotation.

SSE-KMS is the most secure way to encrypt data in Amazon S3. It uses AWS KMS, which is a highly secure key management service that is managed by AWS. AWS KMS logs all key usage, so the company can meet its compliance requirements. AWS KMS also rotates keys automatically, so the company does not have to worry about manually rotating keys.

     mazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. You can use API Gateway to create a REST API that exposes the location data as an API endpoint, allowing you to access the data from your analytics platform.

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code in response to events or HTTP requests. You can use Lambda to write the code that retrieves the location data from your data store and returns it to API Gateway as a response to API requests. This allows you to scale the API to handle a large number of requests without the need to provision or manage any infrastructure.

     The most operationally efficient solution that meets the requirements listed would be option D: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) with automatic rotation.

SSE-KMS allows you to use keys that are managed by the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt your data at rest. KMS is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. With automatic key rotation enabled, KMS will automatically create a new key for you on a regular basis, typically every year, and use it to encrypt your data. This simplifies the key rotation process and reduces the operational burden on your team.

In addition, SSE-KMS provides logging of key usage through AWS CloudTrail, which can be used for auditing purposes.

       Why other options are wrong

Option A: Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) would require you to manage the encryption keys yourself, which can be more operationally burdensome. 

Option B: Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) does not allow for key rotation or logging of the key usage. 

Option C: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) with manual rotation would require you to manually initiate the key rotation process, which can be more operationally burdensome compared to automatic rotation.

     You can choose to have AWS KMS automatically rotate KMS keys every year, provided that those keys were generated within AWS KMS HSMs. Automatic key rotation is not supported for imported keys, asymmetric keys, or keys generated in a CloudHSM cluster using the AWS KMS custom key store feature. If you choose to import keys to AWS KMS or asymmetric keys or use a custom key store, you can manually rotate them by creating a new KMS key and mapping an existing key alias from the old KMS key to the new KMS key.

       AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that can be used to run code in response to specific events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or updates to a DynamoDB table. It could be used to process the location data, but it doesn't provide storage solution. Therefore, it would not be the best option for storing and retrieving location data in this scenario.

     I dont understand why you will vote B?
how are you going to store data with just lambda?
&gt; Which action meets these requirements for storing and retrieving location data

In this use case there will obviously be a ton of data and you want to get real-time location data of the bicycles, and to analyze all these info kinesis is the one that makes most sense here.

     The most viable option for storing and retrieving location data in a multi-tier architecture with the requirements mentioned is D. Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.

Here's why:

Amazon API Gateway: It provides a managed solution for exposing a REST API, which is needed for making the location data accessible to external clients and applications.

Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics: This service is designed to handle real-time data streams and analytics, which is ideal for tracking the location of bicycles during peak operating hours when real-time data processing is essential. Kinesis Data Analytics can efficiently process, analyze, and store the location data from bicycles, making it a good fit for real-time tracking scenarios.

This solution supports the real-time ingestion of location data and enables integration with the company's existing analytics platform for further processing, while also providing access to the data via REST APIs.

       continues here...
Why the other options are less viable:
A. Use Amazon Athena with Amazon S3: While Athena is great for querying large datasets stored in S3, it is not suitable for real-time data processing and tracking since it is more focused on batch querying rather than continuously ingesting and processing live data streams.

B. Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda: While this combination is useful for building scalable APIs, AWS Lambda is not designed for high-throughput real-time data processing or storage of continuous data streams. It would be complex and inefficient for storing and analyzing real-time location data from the bikes.

C. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon Redshift: QuickSight is primarily a data visualization tool, and Redshift is used for data warehousing and batch processing. This combination is not suitable for handling real-time streaming data and making it accessible via a REST API.

     RDS Event Notification: Amazon RDS supports event notifications, which can trigger actions when specific events occur, such as a record update or delete operation. In this case, an event would be triggered when a listing is removed.

Amazon SNS: SNS allows the event to be published to a topic that can then be fanned out to multiple SQS queues. This is useful when you have multiple target systems that need to receive the data. SNS can push the message to all subscribed SQS queues simultaneously.

Amazon SQS: SQS provides reliable message queuing. Each target system can consume messages from its respective SQS queue at its own pace, ensuring that no messages are lost.

AWS Lambda: Lambda functions can be triggered by the SQS queues to process the messages and update the target systems accordingly. This approach allows for asynchronous processing and decouples the RDS update from the target system updates, improving scalability and reliability.

     To meet the requirements for storing and retrieving location data in a multi-tier architecture with accessibility from a REST API, the most viable option would be to use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda. This combination allows for the creation of a serverless architecture that can handle the data points effectively:

Amazon API Gateway: Acts as the front door for the REST API, managing and securing the traffic to the back-end services.
AWS Lambda: Processes the incoming requests from the API Gateway, performs operations such as storing and retrieving location data, and integrates with other AWS services as needed.
This setup enables the bicycle sharing company to have a scalable, cost-effective, and efficient system for tracking the location of its bicycles and integrating the data with its existing analytics platform.

     Interesting point that Amazon RDS event notification doesn't support any notification when data inside DB is updated.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Events.overview.html
So subscription to RDS events  doesn't give any value for Fanout = SNS =&gt; SQS

B is out because FIFO is not required here.

A is left as correct answer

       Option A suggests creating an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for the targets to consume. While this approach can work, it has a few limitations compared to Option D:

Scalability and Fan-out: Option A uses a single SQS queue, which means all target systems would need to poll the same queue. This can become a bottleneck if multiple systems need to process the data simultaneously. Option D, on the other hand, uses an SNS topic to fan out the event to multiple SQS queues, allowing each target system to have its own queue. This improves scalability and ensures that each target system can process the data independently.
Option D offers a more scalable, decoupled, and flexible solution for handling the event notifications and distributing the data to multiple target systems.

       But... SQS is a queue and is incapable of sending messages to "multiple target systems". SNS is pub/sub and topics can be subscribed by multiple apps to update when such an even occurs. Moreover Amazon RDS uses native capabilities of DBs like Postgres, MS SQL for change data capture. This can be used to send notifications to SNS

     RDS events only provide operational events such as DB instance events, DB parameter group events, DB security group events, and DB snapshot events. What we need in the scenario is to capture data-modifying events (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) which can be achieved thru native functions or stored procedures.

       I agree with it requiring a native function or stored procedure, but can they in turn invoke a Lambda function? I have only seen this being possible with Aurora, but not RDS - and I'm not able to find anything googling for it either. I guess it has to be possible, since there's no other option that fits either.

     The best design is **D. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon SNS topic fanned out to multiple Amazon SQS queues. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets**.

- **SNS fan-out** enables sending data to multiple SQS queues for different target systems.
- **Lambda** can process messages from each SQS queue and update the targets.

### Why not others:
- **A** and **B**: No fan-out mechanism, making it harder to deliver to multiple targets.
- **C**: Reverses the typical fan-out pattern (SQS to SNS) and is less efficient.

Option D offers better scalability and decoupling.

     A and C cannot be correct: 

"an (one) SQS queue for the targets (multiple) to consume". 
"an (one) SQS queue fanned out to multiple SNS"

That would be one-to-many relationship, which is not supported by SQS.

"SQS has a many-to-one relationship. You can send messages to a queue from many different producers but only one consumer can be defined."

     I can't understand why people are opting for A but not B. Using a standard SQS queue (non-FIFO) does not guarantee message order and can lead to potential duplicate processing if not handled carefully. This might not be suitable when precise order and exactly-once processing are required, as in the case of removing automobile listings and sending data to multiple systems simultaneously.

     I am not sure why the folks who selected A don't select B instead.  Given that this is basically e-commerce, you would want the action to be processed "exactly once" (i.e. you can only sold a car once).  In that case, FIFO will give "exactly once" behavior over standard, so you don't accidentally carry out an action multiple times for the same sale.

     D could have been a perfect solution but RDS does not create event notifications based on database updates .. You can refer to the link below to the kind of events RDS  triggers notifications for 
=&gt;  https://dzone.com/articles/how-can-i-know-what-happens-inside-amazon-rds#:~:text=an%20event%20subscription.-,AWS%20RDS%20Event%20Categories%20and%20Messages,-Amazon%20RDS%20generates

A is a good alternative that lacks fanning out which will not be necessary if the visibility timeout is adjusted properly and the targets are not many. 

A is the near best alternative so I GO in for A.

     Ans D - "The Object Lock legal hold operation enables you to place a legal hold on an object version. Like setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed."

     The Object Lock legal hold operation enables you to place a legal hold on an object version. Like setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed.

You can use S3 Batch Operations with Object Lock to add legal holds to many Amazon S3 objects at once. You can do this by listing the target objects in your manifest and submitting that list to Batch Operations. Your S3 Batch Operations job with Object Lock legal hold runs until completion, until cancellation, or until a failure state is reached.

     Adding legal holds to objects and managing permissions for users to delete objects does not provide the same level of data immutability and retention control as S3 Object Lock.

B: Closest apart from 100 years as question is asking for indefinite. Governance allows modification by some users

     "With governance mode, you protect objects against being deleted by most users, but you can still grant some users permission to alter the retention settings or delete the objects if necessary."

D is wrong because it applies Object Lock AND Legal Hold, which are two different things that achieve similar results. 'Adding the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission' to user's policies would allow them to remove the Legal Hold but NOT the Object Lock. (Also, it would probably make more sense to add the permissions to the bucket policy, not the "IAM policies of users".)

       Isn't Legal Hold a subcategory of Object Lock? Object Lock itself doesn't imply anything imho: you should go either for a Retention Mode OR Legal Hold. Why would you go for B if they ask "for a nonspecific amount of time"? Open to change my mind.

     "The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable for a nonspecific amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects" = A legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted.

s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission is required in your IAM role to add or remove legal hold from objects.

     My understanding is that the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission allows certain users to apply or remove the legal hold on objects in the S3 bucket. However, having the permission to apply or remove the legal hold does not necessarily mean users can override the hold set by another user.

Once the legal hold is set on an object, it is in effect until the hold is removed by the user who applied it or an admin with the necessary permissions. Other users, even if they have the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission, won't be able to remove the hold unless they are granted access by the user who originally applied it.

     Option B specifies a retention period of 100 years which contradicts what the question asked for.....
"The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable for a nonspecific amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects"
Setting the retention period of 100 years is specific and the company wants new data/objects to remain unchanged for nonspecific amount of time.

Correct answer is D

       FFS 100 years = indefinitely. no company has a policy of keeping data for more than 10 years.
having specific admins run 2 additional commands every time they want to modify an object, is really in sync with nowadays automation processes.
instead of commenting each letter from the question, start thinking. if you were to decide, would you make your users always run commands before modifying or would you rather allow them to directly modify?

     retention period of 100 Years prevents the object to be deleted bevor the retention period expires, so it's not a good fit.

     To meet the requirements of reducing coupling within the application and improving website performance, the solutions architect should consider taking the following actions:

C. Configure the application to upload images directly from each user's browser to Amazon S3 through the use of a pre-signed URL. This will allow the application to upload images directly to S3 without having to go through the web server, which can reduce the load on the web server and improve performance.

D. Configure S3 Event Notifications to invoke an AWS Lambda function when an image is uploaded. Use the function to resize the image. This will allow the application to resize images asynchronously, rather than having to do it synchronously during the upload request, which can improve performance.

       Why other options are wrong
Option A, Configuring the application to upload images to S3 Glacier, is not relevant to improving the performance of image uploads. 

Option B, Configuring the webserver to upload the original images to Amazon S3, is not a recommended solution as it would not reduce coupling within the application or improve performance. 

Option E, Creating an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to resize uploaded images, is not a recommended solution as it would not be able to resize images in a timely manner and would not improve performance.

         About your comments regarding option B)... But if images are being saved directly to S3 instead of the EBS/SSD storage of E2 instances as they originally were, the new approach will reduce coupling and improve performance. Also you have to consider the security concerns about presign URLs as the question does not mention if users are public or private.

         Here it means to decouple the processes, so that the web server don't have to do the resizing, so it doesn't slow down. The customers access the web server, so the web server have to be involved in the process, and how the others already wrote, the pre-signed URL is not the right solution because, of the explanation you can read in the other comments. 

And additional! "Configure the application to upload images directly from EACH USER'S BROWSER to Amazon S3 through the use of a pre-signed URL"

I am not an expert, but I can't imagine that you can store an image that an user uploads in his browser etc.

     Answer is D as the "HIGHEST available" and less "operational complex"
The "Amazon RDS for MySQL with Multi-AZ enabled" option excludes A and B
The "Auto Scaling group" is more available and reduces operational complexity in case of incidents (as remediation it is automated) than just adding one more instance. This excludes C.

     Using Amazon MQ with active/standby brokers provides highly available message queuing across AZs.

Adding an Auto Scaling group for consumer EC2 instances across 2 AZs provides highly available processing.

Using RDS MySQL with Multi-AZ provides a highly available database.

This architecture provides high availability for all components of the system - queue, processing, and database.

     Ans is C - C. Option C uses Amazon MQ with active/standby brokers, adds an additional consumer EC2 instance, and uses Amazon RDS for MySQL with Multi-AZ enabled. Amazon RDS Multi-AZ automatically replicates your database to another AZ and provides automated failover. This ensures high availability for both the messaging system and the database.   Option D- bring More scalabilty rather HA

     The key reasons are:

Amazon MQ active/standby brokers across AZs for queue high availability
Auto Scaling group with consumer EC2 instances across AZs for redundant processing
RDS MySQL with Multi-AZ for database high availability
This combines the HA capabilities of MQ, EC2 and RDS to maximize fault tolerance across all components. The auto scaling also provides flexibility to scale processing capacity as needed.

     Amazon MQ with active/standby brokers configured across two AZ ensures high availability for the message broker. In case of a failure in one AZ, the other AZ's broker can take over seamlessly.

Adding an ASG for the consumer EC2 instances across two AZ provides redundancy and automatic scaling based on demand. If one consumer instance becomes unavailable or if the message load increases, the ASG can automatically launch additional instances to handle the workload.

Using RDS for MySQL with Multi-AZ enabled ensures high availability for the database. Multi-AZ automatically replicates the database to a standby instance in another AZ. If a failure occurs, RDS automatically fails over to the standby instance without manual intervention.

This architecture combines high availability for the message broker (Amazon MQ), scalability and redundancy for the consumer EC2 instances (ASG), and high availability for the database (RDS Multi-AZ). It offers the highest availability with low operational complexity by leveraging managed services and automated failover mechanisms.

     Less operational overhead means A: Fargate (no EC2), move the containers on ECS, autoscaling for growth and ALB to balance consumption.
B - requires configure EC2
C - requires add code (developpers)
D - seems like the most complex approach, like re-architecting the app to take advantage of an HPC platform.

     A is the best solution to meet the requirements with the least operational overhead. The key reasons are:

AWS Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers. Fargate will automatically scale the application based on demand. This removes a significant operational burden.
Using ECS along with Fargate provides a managed orchestration layer to easily run and scale the containerized application.
The Application Load Balancer handles distribution of traffic without additional effort.
No code changes are required to move the application to Fargate. The containers can run as-is.

     Option A (AWS Fargate on Amazon ECS with Service Auto Scaling) is the best choice as it provides a serverless and managed environment for your containerized web application. It requires minimal code changes, offers automatic scaling, and utilizes an Application Load Balancer for request distribution.

Option B (Amazon EC2 instances with an Application Load Balancer) requires manual management of EC2 instances, resulting in more operational overhead compared to option A.

Option C (AWS Lambda with API Gateway) may require significant code changes and restructuring, introducing complexity and potentially increasing development effort.

Option D (AWS ParallelCluster) is not suitable for a containerized web application and involves significant setup and configuration overhead.

     AWS Fargate is a technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances. With Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing.

     A. Use AWS DataSync to move the data. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - No BW available for DataSync, so "asap" will be weeks/months (?)
B. Order an AWS Snowcone device to move the data. Deploy the transformation application to the device. - Snowcone will just store 14TB (SSD configuration).
**C**. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Copy the data to the device. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - SnowBall can store 80TB (ok), takes around 1 week to move the device (faster than A), and AWS Glue allows to do ETL jobs. This is the answer.
D. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device that includes Amazon EC2 compute. Copy the data to the device. Create a new EC2 instance on AWS to run the transformation application. - Same as C, but the ETL job requires the deployment/configuration/maintenance of an EC2 instance, while Glue is serverless. This means D has more operational overhead than C.

       I agree.  When it said "with least Operational overhead" , it does not takes in account "migration activities" neccesary to reach the "final photo/scenario". In  "operational overhead" schema, you're situated in a "final scenario" and you've only take into account how do you operate it, and if the operation of that scheme is ALIGHTED (least effort to operate than original scenario), that's the desired state.

     A and D are wrong. D is the correct answer. 
Why not C:

AWS Snowball Edge is a physical device designed for transferring large amounts of data to and from AWS. It includes some compute capabilities, such as running AWS Lambda functions, AWS IoT Greengrass, and EC2 instances, but it does not support AWS Glue.

AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service that runs within the AWS Cloud. It is designed to work with data stored in AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Redshift, among others. AWS Glue is not available on edge devices like Snowball Edge.

     The answer is D because of the following key points
1. A custom application in the company's data center runs a weekly data transformation job. Which means that the company already has an application that runs the transformation.
2. A solutions architect must transfer the data and must configure the transformation job to continue to run in the AWS Cloud. This shows that the only responsibility of the architect is to transfer the data and configure the existing application to run on the EC2 the architect is going to deploy.

     Not A.  AWS DataSync requires an internet connection &amp; the question states no available bandwidth
Not B. SnowCone only has a max of 14 TB with an SSD, and the data is 50 TB
Not C. Snowball Edge doesn't support Glue
Supported services: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/whatisedge.html

So the answer must be D, as Snowball Edge Storage Optimized does support EC2 &amp; can store 80 TB for the version that support compute resources

     Snowball Edge has storage and compute capabilities, can be used to support workload in offline locations. 

Technically option D will work but with the overhead of EC2, negating the requirement for LEAST ops.

     The Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device allows transferring a large amount of data without using network bandwidth.
Once the data is copied to the Snowball, AWS Glue can be used to create a custom ETL job to transform the data, avoiding the need to reconfigure the existing on-premises application.
This meets the requirements to transfer the data with minimal operational overhead and configure the data transformation job to run in AWS

     Solution C offloads the photo processing to Lambda. Storing the photos in S3 ensures scalability and durability, while keeping the metadata in DynamoDB allows for efficient querying of the associated information.

Option A does not provide an appropriate solution for storing the photos, as DynamoDB is not suitable for storing large binary data like images.

Option B is more focused on real-time streaming data processing and is not the ideal service for processing and storing photos and metadata in this use case.

Option D involves manual scaling and management of EC2 instances, which is less flexible and more labor-intensive compared to the serverless nature of Lambda. It may not efficiently handle the varying number of concurrent users and can introduce higher operational overhead.

In conclusion, option C provides the best solution for scaling the application to meet the needs of the growing user base by leveraging the scalability and durability of Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.

     Option A (creating a NAT gateway) would not meet the requirement since it still involves sending traffic to S3 over the internet. NAT gateway is used for outbound internet connectivity from private subnets, but it doesn't provide a private route for accessing S3.

Option B (configuring security groups) focuses on controlling outbound traffic using security groups. While it can restrict outbound traffic, it doesn't provide a private route for accessing S3.

Option D (setting up Direct Connect) involves establishing a dedicated private network connection between the on-premises environment and AWS. While it offers private connectivity, it is more suitable for hybrid scenarios and not necessary for achieving private access to S3 within the VPC.

In summary, option C provides a straightforward solution by moving the EC2 instances to private subnets, creating a VPC endpoint for S3, and linking the endpoint to the route table for private subnets. This ensures that file transfer traffic between the EC2 instances and S3 remains within the private network without going over the internet.

     The correct answer is C. Move the EC2 instances to private subnets. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, and link the endpoint to the route table for the private subnets.

To meet the new requirement of transferring files over a private route, the EC2 instances should be moved to private subnets, which do not have direct access to the internet. This ensures that the traffic for file transfers does not go over the internet.

To enable the EC2 instances to access Amazon S3, a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 can be created. VPC endpoints allow resources within a VPC to communicate with resources in other services without the traffic being sent over the internet. By linking the VPC endpoint to the route table for the private subnets, the EC2 instances can access Amazon S3 over a private connection within the VPC.

       Option A (Create a NAT gateway) would not work, as a NAT gateway is used to allow resources in private subnets to access the internet, while the requirement is to prevent traffic from going over the internet.

Option B (Configure the security group for the EC2 instances to restrict outbound traffic) would not achieve the goal of routing traffic over a private connection, as the traffic would still be sent over the internet.

Option D (Remove the internet gateway from the VPC and set up an AWS Direct Connect connection) would not be necessary, as the requirement can be met by simply creating a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 and routing traffic through it.

     C is correct. 
There is no requirement for public access from internet. 

Application must be moved in Private subnet. This is a prerequisite in using VPC endpoints with S3

     VPC endpoint is the best choice to route S3 traffic without traversing internet. Option A alone can't be used as NAT Gateway requires an Internet gateway for outbound internet traffic. Option B would still require traversing through internet and option D is also not a suitable solution

     A -&gt; We can configure CloudFront to require HTTPS from clients (enhanced security) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html
D -&gt; storing static website on S3 provides scalability and less operational overhead, then configuration of Application LB and EC2 instances (hence E is out)

B is out since AWS WAF Web ACL does not to provide HTTPS functionality, but to protect HTTPS only.

     agree with A and D

static website -&gt; obviously S3, and S3 is super scalable
CDN -&gt; CloudFront obviously as well, and with HTTPS security is enhanced.

B does not make sense because you are not replacing the CDN with anything,
E works too but takes too much effort and compared to S3, S3 still wins in term of scalability. plus why use EC2 when you are only hosting static website

       Amazon CloudFront is for Securely deliver content with low latency and high transfer speeds
But what about the SQLinjection XSS attacks? we use WAF and olso use HTTPS
https://www.f5.com/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf#:~:text=A%20WAF%20protects%20your%20web,and%20what%20traffic%20is%20safe. 
WAF protects your web apps by filtering, monitoring, and blocking any malicious HTTP/S traffic traveling to the web application, and prevents any unauthorized data from leaving the app.
Answer is WAF Not Cloudfront

     A. Amazon CloudFront provides scalable content delivery with HTTPS functionality, meeting security and scalability requirements.

D. Deploying the website on an Amazon S3 bucket with static website hosting reduces operational overhead by eliminating server maintenance and patching.

Why other options are incorrect:

B. AWS WAF does not provide HTTPS functionality or address patching and maintenance.

C. Using AWS Lambda introduces complexity and does not directly address patching and maintenance.

E. Managing EC2 instances and an Application Load Balancer increases operational overhead and does not minimize patching and maintenance tasks.

In summary, configuring Amazon CloudFront for HTTPS and deploying on Amazon S3 with static website hosting provide security, scalability, and reduced operational overhead.

     D. Create the new website and an Amazon S3 bucket. Deploy the website on the S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled.
A. Configure Amazon CloudFront in front of the website to use HTTPS functionality.

By deploying the website on an S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled, the company can take advantage of the high scalability and cost-efficiency of S3 while also reducing the operational overhead of managing and patching a CMS.
By configuring Amazon CloudFront in front of the website, it will automatically handle the HTTPS functionality, this way the company can have a secure website with very low operational overhead.

       Option A (Configure a CloudWatch Logs subscription to stream the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service)) is not a suitable option, as a CloudWatch Logs subscription is designed to send log events to a destination such as an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic or an AWS Lambda function. It is not designed to write logs directly to Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES).

     The correct answer is C: Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Configure the log group as the delivery stream source. Configure Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) as the delivery stream's destination.

This solution uses Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, which is a fully managed service for streaming data to Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) and other destinations. You can configure the log group as the source of the delivery stream and Amazon OpenSearch Service as the destination. This solution requires minimal operational overhead, as Kinesis Data Firehose automatically scales and handles data delivery, transformation, and indexing.

       Option A: Configure a CloudWatch Logs subscription to stream the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) would also work, but it may require more operational overhead as you would need to set up and manage the subscription and ensure that the logs are delivered in near-real time.

Option B: Create an AWS Lambda function. Use the log group to invoke the function to write the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) would also work, but it may require more operational overhead as you would need to set up and manage the Lambda function and ensure that it scales to handle the incoming logs.

Option D: Install and configure Amazon Kinesis Agent on each application server to deliver the logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Configure Kinesis Data Streams to deliver the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) would also work, but it may require more operational overhead as you would need to install and configure the Kinesis Agent on each application server and set up and manage the Kinesis Data Streams.

       ANSWER A
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/integrations.html
You can use CloudWatch or Kinesis, but in the Kinesis description it never says real time, however in the Cloudwatch description it does say Real time ""You can load streaming data from CloudWatch Logs to your OpenSearch Service domain by using a CloudWatch Logs subscription . For information about Amazon CloudWatch subscriptions, see Real-time processing of log data with subscriptions.""

     Correct Answer:
C. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Configure the log group as the delivery stream's source. Configure Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) as the delivery stream's destination.

Explanation:
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon OpenSearch Service. It requires minimal setup and management, making it a low-overhead solution.
By configuring the log group as the source for the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream and Amazon OpenSearch Service as the destination, logs can be delivered in near-real time with built-in reliability and scalability.

     Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable and cost-effective storage service. It is well-suited for storing large amounts of data, such as the 900 TB of text documents mentioned in the scenario. S3 provides high durability, availability, and performance.

Option A (Amazon EBS) is block storage designed for individual EC2 instances and may not scale as seamlessly and cost-effectively as S3 for large amounts of data.

Option B (Amazon EFS) is a scalable file storage service, but it may not be the most cost-effective option compared to S3, especially for the anticipated storage size of 900 TB.

Option C (Amazon OpenSearch Service) is a search and analytics service and may not be suitable as the primary storage solution for the text documents.

In summary, Amazon S3 is the recommended choice as it offers high scalability, cost-effectiveness, and durability for storing the large repository of text documents required by the web application.

     Now in OpenSearch you can reach at 3 PB so option C is better.
With S3 in an  intensive scenario the costs of retriving the buckets could be high.
Yes OpenSearch is NOT cheap but this has to be analysed carefully.
So, I opt "C" to increase the discussion.

With UltraWarm, you can retain up to 3 PB of data on a single Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster, while reducing your cost per GB by nearly 90% compared to the warm storage tier. You can also easily query and visualize the data in your Kibana interface (version 7.10 and earlier) or OpenSearch Dashboards. Analyze both your recent (weeks) and historical (months or years) log data without spending hours or days restoring archived logs.

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that can store and retrieve large amounts of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. It is designed for high durability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, making it a suitable choice for storing a large repository of text documents. With S3, you can store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web, and you can scale your storage up or down as needed, which will help to meet the demand of the web application. Additionally, S3 allows you to choose between different storage classes, such as standard, infrequent access, and archive, which will enable you to optimize costs based on your specific use case.

Using AWS WAF has several benefits. Additional protection against web attacks using criteria that you specify. You can define criteria using characteristics of web requests such as the following:
Presence of SQL code that is likely to be malicious (known as SQL injection).
Presence of a script that is likely to be malicious (known as cross-site scripting).

AWS Firewall Manager simplifies your administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources for a variety of protections.

No, AWS Firewall Manager security policies are region specific. Each Firewall Manager policy can only include resources available in that specified AWS Region. You can create a new policy for each region where you operate.

So you could not centrally (i.e. in one place) configure policies, you would need to do this is each region

Centralized management: AWS Firewall Manager allows you to centrally manage AWS WAF rules across multiple accounts and regions. This simplifies the configuration and management process.

Consistent security policies: You can enforce consistent security policies across all your API Gateway APIs, ensuring that they are protected from the same threats.

Scalability: AWS Firewall Manager can handle a large number of accounts and resources, making it suitable for global companies with many API Gateway APIs.

Option A involves setting up AWS WAF in both regions and associating regional web ACLs with an API stage. While this can provide the necessary protection, it requires more manual configuration in each region, potentially leading to more administrative effort, especially if there are updates or changes needed to be made across multiple regions.

Therefore, Option B is likely to require the least amount of administrative effort.

B assumes there are WAFs already in place and why would you want to deploy a Firewall Manager to manage 1 Firewall? it adds unnecessary administrative tasks and costs for a tool that is not needed. You would want that if you were managing 10+ Firewalls not just one. A makes the most sense.

     Are AWS firewall Manager security policies region specific?
Q: Can I create protection policies across regions? No, Amazon Firewall Manager protection policies are region specific. Each Firewall Manager policy can only include resources available in that specified Amazon Web Services Region. You can create a new policy for each region where you operate.

     Option B. Create a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Establish endpoint groups in us-west-2 and eu-west-1. Add two NLBs as endpoints of the endpoint group.

AWS Global Accelerator is a network service that can provide a global traffic management solution. By creating a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator, you can guide user traffic to the endpoint closest to them, thereby improving the performance and availability of the application. In this case, you can establish endpoint groups in the us-west-2 and eu-west-1 regions, and add two NLBs as endpoints. In this way, no matter where the user is located, their requests will be routed to the EC2 instance closest to them, thereby improving the performance and availability of DNS resolution. In addition, this design can also provide flexibility and scalability to handle a large amount of traffic. Therefore, this solution can meet your needs.

     Global Accelerator: AWS Global Accelerator is designed to improve the availability and performance of applications by using static IP addresses (Anycast IPs) and routing traffic over the AWS global network infrastructure.

Endpoint Groups: By creating endpoint groups in both the us-west-2 and eu-west-1 Regions, the company can effectively distribute traffic to the NLBs in both Regions. This improves availability and allows traffic to be directed to the closest Region based on latency.

     B is the best solution to route traffic to all the EC2 instances across regions.

The key reasons are:

AWS Global Accelerator allows routing traffic to endpoints in multiple AWS Regions. It uses the AWS global network to optimize availability and performance.
Creating an accelerator with endpoint groups in us-west-2 and eu-west-1 allows traffic to be distributed across both regions.
Adding the NLBs in each region as endpoints allows the traffic to be routed to the EC2 instances behind them.
This provides improved performance and availability compared to just using Route 53 geolocation routing.

     Option B offers a global solution by utilizing Global Accelerator. By creating a standard accelerator and configuring endpoint groups in both Regions, the company can route traffic to all the EC2 across multiple regions. Adding the two NLBs as endpoints ensures that traffic is distributed effectively.

Option A does not directly address the requirement of routing traffic to all EC2 instances. It focuses on routing based on geolocation and using CloudFront as a distribution, which may not achieve the desired outcome.

Option C involves managing Elastic IP addresses and routing based on geolocation. However, it may not provide the same level of performance and availability as AWS Global Accelerator.

Option D focuses on ALBs and latency-based routing. While it can be a valid solution, it does not utilize AWS Global Accelerator and may require more configuration and management compared to option B.

     "You can enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, but not after it's created. However, you can add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance by creating a snapshot of your DB instance, and then creating an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot to get an encrypted copy of your original DB instance."

       I agree, there is no reason to copy all of the snapshots and ecnrypt them all.  You just need one encrypted snapshot, moving forward they will all be encrypted. C is close but I think there is no reason to copy all the snapshots plural.  There is a wizard to go through and select the snapshot to encrypt.  "In the Amazon RDS console navigation pane, choose Snapshots, and select the DB snapshot you created. For Actions, choose Copy Snapshot. Provide the destination AWS Region and the name of the DB snapshot copy in the corresponding fields. Select the Enable Encryption checkbox. For Master Key, specify the KMS key identifier to use to encrypt the DB snapshot copy. Choose Copy Snapshot. For more information, see Copying a snapshot in the Amazon RDS documentation".  What if you had 30 snapshotS?  You just need to do it once.

     A. Replacing the existing DB instance with an encrypted snapshot can result in downtime and potential data loss during migration.

B. Creating a new encrypted EBS volume for snapshots does not address the encryption of the DB instance itself.

D. Copying snapshots to an encrypted S3 bucket only encrypts the snapshots, but does not address the encryption of the DB instance.

Option C is the most suitable as it involves copying and encrypting the snapshots using AWS KMS, ensuring encryption for both the database and snapshots.

I don't see any other difference btw those two options. 
Option A is clearly the correct on as all you need is the latest snapshot.

You can only encrypt an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, not after the DB instance is created.
However, because you can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot, you can effectively add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance. That is, you can create a snapshot of your DB instance, and then create an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot, and thus you have an encrypted copy of your original DB instance.

       BUT you can't restore encrypted snapshot to an existing DB instance.Only no NEW DB (not an existing one). The procedure described in this way:
"(...) you can add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance by creating a snapshot of your DB instance, and then creating an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot to get an encrypted copy of your original DB instance."

refers to create a NEW DB instance (this encrypted), never restoring in a existing one.
The RDB engine understands that restoring from a encrypted snapshot is form create an encrypted NEW database.

     If you are a developer who needs to digitally sign or verify data using asymmetric keys, you should use the service to create and manage the private keys you'll need. If you're looking for a scalable key management infrastructure to support your developers and their growing number of applications, you should use it to reduce your licensing costs and operational burden...

     The correct answer is Option B. To reduce the operational burden, the solutions architect should use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to protect the encryption keys.

AWS KMS is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create and manage encryption keys. It allows developers to easily encrypt and decrypt data in their applications, and it automatically handles the underlying key management tasks, such as key generation, key rotation, and key deletion. This can help to reduce the operational burden associated with key management.

     AWS KMS handles the encryption key management, rotation, and auditing. This removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting for developers.
KMS integrates natively with many AWS services like S3, EBS, RDS for encryption. This makes it easy to encrypt data.
KMS scales automatically as key usage increases. Developers don't have to worry about provisioning key infrastructure.
Fine-grained access controls are available via IAM policies and grants. KMS is secure by default.
Features like envelope encryption make compliance easier for regulated workloads.
AWS handles the hardware security modules (HSMs) for cryptographic key storage

     By utilizing AWS KMS, the company can offload the operational responsibilities of key management, including key generation, rotation, and protection. AWS KMS provides a scalable and secure infrastructure for managing encryption keys, allowing developers to easily integrate encryption into their applications without the need to manage the underlying key infrastructure.

Option A (MFA), option C (ACM), and option D (IAM policy) are not directly related to reducing the operational burden of key management. While these options may provide additional security measures or access controls, they do not specifically address the scalability and management aspects of a key management infrastructure. AWS KMS is designed to simplify the key management process and is the most suitable option for reducing the operational burden in this scenario.

     If you are responsible for securing your data across AWS services, you should use it to centrally manage the encryption keys that control access to your data. If you are a developer who needs to encrypt data in your applications, you should use the AWS Encryption SDK with AWS KMS to easily generate, use and protect symmetric encryption keys in your code.

     The correct answer is D. To increase the application's performance, the solutions architect should import the SSL certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener that uses the SSL certificate from ACM.

An Application Load Balancer (ALB) can offload the SSL termination process from the EC2 instances, which can help to increase the compute capacity available for the web application. By creating an ALB with an HTTPS listener and using the SSL certificate from ACM, the ALB can handle the SSL termination process, leaving the EC2 instances free to focus on running the web application.

     The key reasons are:

Using an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener allows SSL termination to happen at the load balancer layer.
The EC2 instances behind the load balancer receive only unencrypted traffic, reducing load on them.
Importing the custom SSL certificate into ACM allows the ALB to use it for HTTPS listeners.
This removes the need to install and manage SSL certificates on each EC2 instance.
ALB handles the SSL overhead and scales automatically. The EC2 fleet focuses on app logic.
Options A, B, C don't offload SSL overhead from the EC2 instances themselves.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <p>
     <strong>
      Comment:
     </strong>
     By using ACM to manage the SSL certificate and configuring an ALB with HTTPS listener, the SSL termination will be handled by the load balancer instead of the web servers. This offloading of SSL processing to the ALB reduces the compute capacity burden on the web servers and improves their performance by allowing them to focus on serving the dynamic web application.

Option A suggests creating a new SSL certificate using ACM, but it does not address the SSL termination offloading and load balancing capabilities provided by an ALB.

Option B suggests migrating the SSL certificate to an S3 bucket, but this approach does not provide the necessary SSL termination and load balancing functionalities.

Option C suggests creating another EC2 instance as a proxy server, but this adds unnecessary complexity and management overhead without leveraging the benefits of ALB's built-in load balancing and SSL termination capabilities.

Therefore, option D is the most suitable choice to increase the application's performance in this scenario.

     SSL termination is the process of ending an SSL/TLS connection. This is typically done by a device, such as a load balancer or a reverse proxy, that is positioned in front of one or more web servers. The device decrypts incoming SSL/TLS traffic and then forwards the unencrypted request to the web server. This allows the web server to process the request without the overhead of decrypting and encrypting the traffic. The device then re-encrypts the response from the web server and sends it back to the client. This allows the device to offload the SSL/TLS processing from the web servers and also allows for features such as SSL offloading, SSL bridging, and SSL acceleration.

     The key reasons are:

Spot can provide significant cost savings (up to 90%) compared to On-Demand.
Since the job is stateless and can be stopped/restarted anytime, the intermittent availability of Spot is not an issue.
Spot supports the same instance types as On-Demand, so optimal instance types can be chosen.
For a 60+ minute batch job, the chance of Spot interruption is low. But if it happens, the job can just be restarted.
Reserved Instances don't offer any advantage for a highly dynamic job like this.
Lambda is not a good fit given the long runtime requirement.

     The correct answer is Option A. To design a scalable and cost-effective solution for the batch processing job, the solutions architect should recommend implementing EC2 Spot Instances.

EC2 Spot Instances allow users to bid on spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity and can be a cost-effective solution for stateless, interruptible workloads that can be started and stopped at any time. Since the batch processing job is stateless, can be started and stopped at any time, and typically takes upwards of 60 minutes to complete, EC2 Spot Instances would be a good fit for this workload.

NAT gateways can be configured in each private subnet to provide internet access for the EC2 instances to communicate with the third-party web service.

     A and E!
Application has to be highly available while the instance and database should not be exposed to the public internet, but the instances still requires access to the internet. NAT gateway has to be deployed in public subnets in this case while instances and database remain in private subnets in the VPC, therefore answer is (A) and (E).
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html

If the instances did not require access to the internet, then the answer could have been
(B) to use a private NAT gateway and keep it in the private subnets to communicate only to the VPCs.

         Because NAT gateways are availability zone specific, if you need HA you will need a NAT gateway in each availability zone.

A because the EC2 can't be exposed to public
E because each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.

     Option A ensures that EC2 instances and RDS DB instance are not exposed to the public internet, as they are launched in private subnets. Auto Scaling group will also ensure high availability of EC2 instances.
Option D configures a VPC with a public subnet for the load balancer, and a private subnet for the EC2 instances and RDS DB instance. NAT gateways in both Availability Zones will allow EC2 instances to access the internet for payment processing, while keeping them private.

     There might be error in question. i modified it now CE answer seems to be correct 

A company runs its two-tier ecommerce website on AWS. The web tier consists of a load balancer that sends traffic to Amazon EC2 instances. The database tier uses an Amazon RDS DB instance. The RDS DB instance should not be exposed to the public internet. The The RDS DB instance require internet access to complete payment processing of orders through a third-party web service. The application must be highly available.

Which combination of configuration options will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

     Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in private subnets. Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets.
This ensures that the EC2 instances and the RDS DB instance are not exposed to the public internet.
Configure a VPC with two private subnets and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the private subnets.
This allows the EC2 instances in private subnets to access the internet for payment processing through the NAT gateways while keeping them private.

     Why Not C? Because Intelligent Tier  the objects are automatically moved to different tiers.
The question says "the data from most recent 2 yrs should be highly available and immediately retrievable", which means in intelligent tier , if you activate archiving option(as Option C specifies) , the objects will be moved to Archive tiers(instant to access to deep archive access tiers) in 90 to 730 days. Remember these archive tiers performance will be similar to S3 glacier flexible and s3 deep archive which means files cannot be retrieved immediately within 2 yrs .

We have a hard requirement in question which says it should be retreivable immediately for the 2 yrs.  which cannot be acheived in Intelligent tier.  So B is the correct option imho.

Because of the above reason Its possible only in S3 standard and then configure lifecycle configuration to move to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 yrs.

       Mmm.. You can enable Intelligent-Tiering and take advantage of of the infrequent Access tier and thus reducing costs. To avoid moving objects to the deep archive tier before the two years it would be enough to enable ONLY the check "Deep Archive Access tier" and set days to 720 (two years, which is curiously the maximum value), and keep disabled the check "Archive Access tier" to avoid the Intelligent-Tiering move objects to the non-instant retrieval tier. That will work, offcourse this specific configuration is not mention in the question which leaves some doubts about which option is the correct.

     Option A is incorrect because immediately transitioning objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive would not fulfill the requirement of keeping the most recent 2 years of data highly available and immediately retrievable.

Option C is also incorrect because using S3 Intelligent-Tiering with archiving option would not meet the requirement of immediately retrievable data for the most recent 2 years.

Option D is not the best choice because transitioning objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) and then to S3 Glacier Deep Archive would not satisfy the requirement of immediately retrievable data for the most recent 2 years.

Option B is the correct solution. By setting up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years, the company can keep all data for at least 25 years while ensuring that data from the most recent 2 years remains highly available and immediately retrievable in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. This solution optimizes storage costs by leveraging the Glacier Deep Archive for long-term storage.

     It's pretty straight forward.

S3 Standard answers for High Availaibility/Immediate retrieval for 2 years. S3 Intelligent Tiering would just incur additional cost of analysis while the company insures that it requires immediate retrieval in any moment and without risk to Availability. So a capital B

       Answer is A
While instance store provides fast local storage, it is ephemeral (data is lost when the instance stops or terminates). It's not suitable for workloads that require persistence, like video processing that may span across multiple EC2 instances over time. EBS provides persistent, high-performance storage.

           Only the following instance types support an instance store volume as the root device: C3, D2, G2, I2, M3, and R3, and we're using an I3, so an instance store volume is irrelevant.

             THE CORRECT ANSWER IS A. 

The biggest Instance Store Storage Optimized option (is4gen.8xlarge) has a capacity of only 3TB.

     The correct Answer is A : 
Amazon EC2 instance store (Instance Store) is usually not the best choice because the storage it provides is temporary and tied to the life cycle of the instance. When an instance is stopped or terminated, data on the instance store is lost.

In this scenario, the company's requirements were to have the maximum possible I/O performance and required durable data storage. Therefore, using Amazon EC2 Instance Store does not meet these requirements because it lacks durability.

In contrast, Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent regional block storage and can meet the needs of high-performance I/O. Therefore, the answer should include Amazon EBS, not Amazon EC2 instance storage.

       "The company's requirements were to have the maximum possible I/O performance and required durable data storage." Yeah, but not for the same data.

10 TB "maximum possible I/O performance" for processing (= temporary)
300 TB "very durable" (= S3)
900 TB "for archival" (= Glacier)

     Although the EC2 instance store is ephemeral, it provides the highest performance, and there is no demand of a presistant data storage for video processing, the best option for storing media is s3, which is an object storage system.

     Correct Answer:
A. Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage

Explanation:
Amazon EBS for maximum performance: Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides high-performance block storage for use with Amazon EC2. It is well-suited for workloads requiring high I/O performance, such as video processing.
Amazon S3 for durable data storage: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) offers highly durable and scalable object storage. It is ideal for storing large amounts of media content with high durability.
Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage: Amazon S3 Glacier is a low-cost storage service for data archiving and long-term backup. It is perfect for storing archival media that is not frequently accessed but needs to be preserved.

     Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): Provides high I/O performance suitable for video processing tasks.
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Offers very durable and scalable storage, ideal for storing large amounts of media content.
Amazon EFS (Elastic File System): While it provides scalable and durable storage, it is optimized for file-based workloads rather than object storage, which is less suitable for large-scale media storage

     The best option for the given requirements would be:

A. Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage.

Explanation:

Amazon EBS for maximum performance: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides high-performance block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. This is suitable for the 10 TB of storage with maximum possible I/O performance required for video processing.

Amazon S3 for durable data storage: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is highly durable, scalable, and secure object storage. It's suitable for the 300 TB of very durable storage needed for storing media content.

Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage: Amazon S3 Glacier provides secure, durable, and low-cost storage for data archiving and long-term backup. It's ideal for the 900 TB of storage required for archival media that is not in use anymore.

      Comment:
     </strong>
     the answer is D
From a maximum I/O perspective, Amazon EBS is significantly better than Amazon EC2 instance store for two main reasons:

1. Underlying Storage Technology:

Amazon EBS: Utilizes Solid State Drives (SSDs) and NVMe storage options, offering high-performance IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) and throughput.
Amazon EC2 Instance Store: Relies on the local hard disk drives (HDDs) attached to the EC2 instance, which have significantly lower IOPS and throughput compared to SSDs.

       Using Amazon EKS with managed node groups simplifies container orchestration by reducing the operational overhead of managing the underlying infrastructure and Kubernetes control plane. EKS automatically handles tasks like patching, scaling, and deploying containers across multiple nodes, further reducing operational effort.
While Spot Instances in an EC2 Auto Scaling group can reduce costs, it requires more manual management of container orchestration (e.g., deploying, scaling, and managing containers across instances), increasing operational overhead compared to EKS.
In the exam its highly recommended to select Managed services Like EKS in this case.
My choice is B.

       In my opinion option A) seems to be a reasonable at first because setting up AWS EKS might be seem as an operation overhead comparing to the option of running the containers inside the EC2 using docker just as you we do on your own machines. However, consider installing docker on multiple EC2 instances and manually manage docker instances and images will end up in chaos, so, as a conclusion, the operational cost of setting up AWS EKS will worth the effort.

     Answer is A:
Amazon ECS: ECS itself is free, you pay only for Amazon EC2 resources you use.
Amazon EKS: The EKS management layer incurs an additional cost of $144 per month per cluster.
Advantages of Amazon ECS include: Spot instances: Because containers are immutable, you can run many workloads using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances (which can be shut down with no advance notice) and save 90% on on-demand instance costs.

     IMHO, the option **B** is the right one.
Breaking down the reasons for it:
1 - Spot is much cheaper than on-demand, which already eliminates C&amp;D for cost related.
2 - Even though we can create a bootstrap script to install docker, managing this can be complicated, especially if any of the applications require more than one instance running.

     Spot instances for disruption friendly containers which are also cheaper.
EKS allows using spot instances from a managed node group that takes away the EC2 operational overhead.
Link: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-now-supports-provisioning-and-managing-ec2-spot-instances-in-managed-node-groups/
"Previously, customers had to run Spot Instances as self-managed worker nodes in their EKS clusters. This meant doing some heavy lifting such as building and maintaining configuration for Spot Instances in EC2 Auto Scaling groups, deploying a tool for handling Spot interruptions gracefully, deploying AMI updates, and updating the kubelet version running on their worker nodes. Now, all you need to do is supply a single parameter to indicate that a managed node group should launch Spot Instances, and provide multiple instance types that would be used by the underlying EC2 Auto Scaling group."

     Requirement is to reduce operational overhead,

     The reasons are:

Migrating the database to Amazon Aurora provides a high performance, scalable PostgreSQL-compatible database with minimal overhead.
Migrating the containerized web app to Fargate removes the need to provision and manage EC2 instances. Fargate auto-scales.
Together, Aurora and Fargate reduce operational overhead and complexity for the data and application tiers.

     A is the correct answer because migrating the database to Amazon Aurora reduces operational overhead and offers scalability and automated backups.

E is the correct answer because migrating the web application to AWS Fargate with Amazon ECS eliminates the need for infrastructure management, simplifies deployment, and improves resource utilization.

B. Migrating the web application to Amazon EC2 instances would not directly address the operational overhead and capacity planning concerns mentioned in the scenario.

C. Setting up an Amazon CloudFront distribution improves content delivery but does not directly address the operational overhead or capacity planning limitations.

D. Configuring Amazon ElastiCache improves performance but does not directly address the operational overhead or capacity planning challenges mentioned.

Therefore, the correct answers are A and E as they address the requirements, while the incorrect answers (B, C, D) do not provide the desired solutions.

     The correct answers are A and E. To improve the application's infrastructure, the solutions architect should migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora and migrate the web application to be hosted on AWS Fargate with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).

Amazon Aurora is a fully managed, scalable, and highly available relational database service that is compatible with PostgreSQL. Migrating the database to Amazon Aurora would reduce the operational overhead of maintaining the database infrastructure and allow the company to focus on building and scaling the application.

AWS Fargate is a fully managed container orchestration service that enables users to run containers without the need to manage the underlying EC2 instances. By using AWS Fargate with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), the solutions architect can improve the scalability and efficiency of the web application and reduce the operational overhead of maintaining the underlying infrastructure.

     The correct answer is B. To maintain the desired performance across all instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, the solutions architect should use a target tracking policy to dynamically scale the Auto Scaling group.

A target tracking policy allows the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in the group based on a target value for a metric. In this case, the target value for the CPU utilization metric could be set to 40% to maintain the desired performance of the application. The Auto Scaling group would then automatically scale the number of instances up or down as needed to maintain the target value for the metric.

     40% CPU for best performance is a "target tracking" policy for scaling so B is correct.
A: Wrong policy
CD: Won't achieve 40% CPU

     The application performs best when the CPU utilization of the EC2 instances is at or near 40%. 
Target tracking will maintain CPU utilization at 40%. When CloudWatch detects that the average CPU utilization is beyond 40%, it will trigger the target tracking policy to scale out the auto scaling group to meet this target utilization. Once everything is settled and the average CPU utilization has gone below 40%, another scale in action will kick in and reduce the number of auto scaling instances in the auto scaling group.

     The key reasons are:

A target tracking policy allows defining a specific target metric value to maintain, in this case 40% CPU utilization.
Auto Scaling will automatically add or remove instances to keep utilization at the target level, without manual intervention.
This will dynamically scale the group to maintain performance as load changes.
A simple scaling policy only responds to breaching thresholds, not maintaining a target.
Scheduled actions and Lambda would require manual calculation and updates to track utilization.
Target tracking policies are the native Auto Scaling feature designed to maintain a metric at a target value.

     Target tracking policy is the most appropriate choice. This policy allows ASG to automatically adjust the desired capacity based on a target metric, such as CPU utilization. By setting the target metric to 40%, ASG will scale the number of instances up or down as needed to maintain the desired CPU utilization level. This ensures that the application's performance remains optimal.

A suggests using a simple scaling policy, which allows for scaling based on a fixed metric or threshold. However, it may not be as effective as a target tracking policy in dynamically adjusting the capacity to maintain a specific CPU utilization level.

C suggests using an Lambda to update the desired capacity. While this can be done programmatically, it would require custom scripting and may not provide the same level of automation and responsiveness as a target tracking policy.

D suggests using scheduled scaling actions to scale up and down ASG at predefined times. This approach is not suitable for maintaining the desired performance in real-time based on actual CPU utilization.

     B seem to the correct response.

With a target tracking scaling policy, you can increase or decrease the current capacity of the group based on a target value for a specific metric. This policy will help resolve the over-provisioning of your resources. The scaling policy adds or removes capacity as required to keep the metric at, or close to, the specified target value. In addition to keeping the metric close to the target value, a target tracking scaling policy also adjusts to changes in the metric due to a changing load pattern.

     The key reasons are:

An OAI provides secure access between CloudFront and S3 without exposing the S3 bucket publicly.
The OAI is associated with the CloudFront distribution.
The S3 bucket policy limits access only to that OAI.
This ensures only CloudFront can access the objects, not direct S3 access.
Option A is complex to manage individual bucket policies.
Option B exposes credentials that aren't needed.
Option C works but OAI is the preferred method.
So using an origin access identity provides the most secure way to serve private S3 content through CloudFront. The OAI prevents direct public access to the S3 bucket.

     To meet the requirements of serving files through CloudFront while restricting direct access to the S3 bucket URL, the recommended approach is to use an origin access identity (OAI). By creating an OAI and assigning it to the CloudFront distribution, you can control access to the S3 bucket.
This setup ensures that the files stored in the S3 bucket are only accessible through CloudFront and not directly through the S3 bucket URL. Requests made directly to the S3 URL will be blocked.


Option A suggests writing individual policies for each S3 bucket, which can be cumbersome and difficult to manage, especially if there are multiple buckets involved.

Option B suggests creating an IAM user and assigning it to CloudFront, but this does not address restricting direct access to the S3 bucket URL.

Option C suggests writing an S3 bucket policy with CloudFront distribution ID as the Principal, but this alone does not provide the necessary restrictions to prevent direct access to the S3 bucket URL.

     DECEMBER 2022 UPDATE:

Restricting access to an Amazon S3 origin:

CloudFront provides two ways to send authenticated requests to an Amazon S3 origin: origin access control (OAC) and origin access identity (OAI). We recommend using OAC because it supports:

All Amazon S3 buckets in all AWS Regions, including opt-in Regions launched after December 2022
Amazon S3 server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
Dynamic requests (PUT and DELETE) to Amazon S3

OAI doesn't work for the scenarios in the preceding list, or it requires extra workarounds in those scenarios.

     The correct answer is D. To meet the requirements, the solutions architect should create an origin access identity (OAI) and assign it to the CloudFront distribution. The S3 bucket permissions should be configured so that only the OAI has read permission.

An OAI is a special CloudFront user that is associated with a CloudFront distribution and is used to give CloudFront access to the files in an S3 bucket. By using an OAI, the company can serve the files through the CloudFront distribution while preventing direct access to the S3 bucket.

     By using CloudFront, the website can leverage the global network of edge locations to cache and deliver the performance reports to users from the nearest edge location, reducing latency and providing fast response times. Amazon S3 serves as the origin for the files, where the reports are stored.

Option B is incorrect because AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB are not the most suitable services for serving downloadable files and meeting the website demands globally.

Option C is incorrect because using an Application Load Balancer with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may require more infrastructure provisioning and management compared to the CloudFront and S3 combination. Additionally, it may not provide the same level of global scalability and fast response times as CloudFront.

Option D is incorrect because while Amazon Route 53 is a global DNS service, it alone does not provide the caching and content delivery capabilities required for serving the downloadable reports. Internal Application Load Balancers do not address the global scalability and caching requirements specified in the scenario.

     B, D - do not have access to underlying OS.
Both A and C could work, but C is less Overhead.

C - Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle actually supports creating read replicas. "Creating an RDS Custom for Oracle replica is similar to creating an RDS for Oracle replica, but with important differences." (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-rr.html). The read replica is not meant for disaster recovery, but it could work as such when no better options are available.

     Answer C is not correct as cross-Region replicas in RDS Custom for Oracle are not allowed as stated by a previous answe.

Correct answer: B https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReplicateBackups.html

Low operational overhead since the backup is automated.

     C. Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. Create a read replica for the database in another AWS Region.

Explanation:

Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle: Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle allows the company to run Oracle databases on managed instances in the AWS Cloud. It provides managed services for tasks such as backups, patching, and monitoring, minimizing operational overhead for normal operations.
Read Replica in Another AWS Region: By creating a read replica for the database in another AWS Region, the company can set up disaster recovery (DR) with minimal operational overhead. Amazon RDS automatically handles replication between the primary database and the read replica, ensuring data consistency and minimizing management tasks for DR setup.

     A. Migrate the Oracle database to an Amazon EC2 instance. Set up database replication to a different AWS Region.

Explanation:

Migrating the Oracle database to an Amazon EC2 instance allows the company to maintain full control over the database, including access to the underlying operating system.
Setting up database replication to a different AWS Region ensures disaster recovery with minimal operational overhead.

     SSE-KMS vs SSE-S3 - The last seems to have less overhead (as the keys are automatically generated by S3 and applied on data at upload, and don't require further actions. KMS provides more flexibility, but in turn involves a different service, which finally is more "complex" than just managing one (S3). So A and B are excluded. If you are in doubt, you are having 2 buckets in A and B, while just keeping one in C and D.
https://s3browser.com/server-side-encryption-types.aspx 
Decide between C and D is deciding on Athena or RDS. RDS is a relational db, and we have documents on S3, which is the use case for Athena. Athena is also serverless, which eliminates the need of controlling the underlying infrastructure and capacity. So C is the answer.

         Answer A has you move the data before you enable replication, therefore there is no difference between A and C when it comes to the point in time you enable replication. I agree A would be a better choice if the order of operations said, create a bucket-&gt;Enable encryption-&gt;move files...but it doesn't. It has you create the bucket and move the files.

     Answer is A: 
Amazon S3 Bucket Keys reduce the cost of Amazon S3 server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS). This new bucket-level key for SSE can reduce AWS KMS request costs by up to 99 percent by decreasing the request traffic from Amazon S3 to AWS KMS. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, and without any changes to your client applications, you can configure your bucket to use an S3 Bucket Key for AWS KMS-based encryption on new objects.
The Existing S3 bucket might have uncrypted data - encryption will apply new data received after the applying of encryption on the new bucket.

     from @pentium75

Data in S3 is queried with Athena, not RDS, thus B and D are out.

A requires a new bucket and loading data into that - Why, since data is already in S3? It says to enable CRR only after loading the data, so existing data won't be replicated anyway.

C uses existing data (less operational overhead compared to loading data into a new bucket) and SSE-E3 (less operational overhead than SSE-KMS).

     Option B suggests using Amazon RDS to query the data, which introduces additional complexity compared to using Amazon Athena.
Option C suggests using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) instead of AWS KMS multi-Region keys, which might not meet the encryption requirements.
Option D also suggests using Amazon RDS to query the data, which, as mentioned earlier, is not the best choice for a serverless solution and would result in higher operational overhead.

     The answer is A because SSE-S3 does not support cross-region replication of encrypted data. If you perform cross-region replication, you will have to re-encrypt the data.

     As per Amazon Q:
The easiest way to encrypt existing objects in S3 is to use server-side encryption with S3-managed keys (SSE-S3). Here are the basic steps:
1. Enable SSE-S3 on the target S3 bucket if it is not already enabled. This will ensure all new or copied objects are encrypted automatically.
2. Create an S3 inventory report for the source bucket containing the objects. This will generate a CSV file with metadata of all objects.
3. Use S3 Select or AWS Athena to query the inventory report and filter for only unencrypted objects.
4. Create an S3 Batch Operations job to copy the filtered unencrypted objects to the target bucket. The copy operation will automatically encrypt the objects using the bucket's SSE-S3 configuration.

       5. Monitor the job completion to ensure all objects were encrypted. You can optionally delete the original unencrypted versions after verifying successful encryption.
This approach minimizes disruption and performs the encryption without having to rewrite existing data or code.

     The solution that meets these requirements best is option D.

By asking the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service, the company can use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service. This enables the company to access the service privately and securely over an Amazon VPC endpoint, without requiring a NAT gateway, VPN, or AWS Direct Connect. Additionally, this will restrict the connectivity only to the target service, as required by the company's security team.

Option A VPC peering connection may not meet security requirement as it can allow communication between all resources in both VPCs.
Option B, asking the provider to create a virtual private gateway in its VPC and use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service is not the optimal solution because it may require the provider to make changes and also you may face security issues.
Option C, creating a NAT gateway in a public subnet of the company's VPC can expose the target service to the internet, which would not meet the security requirements.

     The best solution to meet the requirements is option D:

Ask the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service
Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service
The reasons are:

PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs without using public internet.
The provider creates a VPC endpoint in their VPC for the target service.
The company uses PrivateLink to securely access the endpoint from their VPC.
Connectivity is restricted only to the target service.
The connection is initiated only from the company's VPC.
Options A, B, C would expose the connection to the public internet or require infrastructure changes in the provider's VPC.

PrivateLink enables private, restricted connectivity to the target service without VPC peering or public exposure.

     Option C meets the requirements of establishing a private and restricted connection to the service hosted in the provider's VPC. By asking the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service, you can establish a direct and private connection from your company's VPC to the target service. AWS PrivateLink ensures that the connectivity remains within the AWS network and does not require internet access. This ensures both privacy and restriction to the target service, as the connection can only be initiated from your company's VPC.

A. VPC peering does not restrict access only to the target service.
B. PrivateLink is typically used for accessing AWS services, not external services in a provider's VPC.
C. NAT gateway does not provide a private and restricted connection to the target service.

Option D is the correct choice as it uses AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoint to establish a private and restricted connection from the company's VPC to the target service in the provider's VPC.

     VPC Peering Connection:
All resources in a VPC, such as ECSs and load balancers, can be accessed.

VPC Endpoint:
Allows access to a specific service or application. Only the ECSs and load balancers in the VPC for which VPC endpoint services are created can be accessed.

     PrivateLink is a more generalized technology for linking VPCs to other services. This can include multiple potential endpoints: AWS services, such as Lambda or EC2; Services hosted in other VPCs; Application endpoints hosted on-premises.

     While VPC peering enables you to privately connect VPCs, AWS PrivateLink enables you to configure applications or services in VPCs as endpoints that your VPC peering connections can connect to.

     The solution that meets these requirements is Option D:

* Ask the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service.
* Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.

Option D involves asking the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service, which is a private connection to the service that is hosted in the provider's VPC. This ensures that the connection is private and restricted to the target service, as required by the company's security team. The company can then use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service over the VPC endpoint. AWS PrivateLink is a fully managed service that enables you to privately access services hosted on AWS, on-premises, or in other VPCs. It provides secure and private connectivity to services by using private IP addresses, which ensures that traffic stays within the Amazon network and does not traverse the public internet. 

Therefore, Option D is the solution that meets the requirements.

     AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database.
... With AWS Database Migration Service, you can also continuously replicate data with low latency from any supported source to any supported target.

Analysis:
Option A satisfy the requirement of “synchronized with the on-premises database”
Option C suits for the homogeneous database migration.
Option D is not needed in this scenario, it suits for the heterogeneous database.

     To meet the requirements of migrating an on-premises PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL while keeping the on-premises database online and ensuring synchronization with the Aurora database, the following actions need to be taken:

Create an ongoing replication task (Option A): This action involves setting up continuous replication between the on-premises PostgreSQL database and the Aurora PostgreSQL database. This ensures that changes made to the on-premises database are replicated to the Aurora database in real-time, keeping them synchronized.
Create an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) replication server (Option C): AWS DMS provides a reliable and efficient way to migrate databases to AWS while minimizing downtime. By creating an AWS DMS replication server, you can configure and manage the replication tasks between the on-premises database and the Aurora database.

A is out because it does not specify what is the service to perform the replication task, clearly what needed here is DMS
B is out because backup is solution to keep 2 DB in sync, backup and restore takes long time
C is correct as DMS takes care both full load and ongoing replication, see this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhXDa9SPDLw 
D is right as from to PostgreSQL to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL you need AWS Schema Conversion Tool, see https://aws.amazon.com/dms/schema-conversion-tool/
E is out monitor itself doen't perform the replication work, if we have to choose 3 options then we can have E selected

     C. Create an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) replication server.
E. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to monitor the database synchronization.

AWS DMS can replicate data from on-premises databases to Aurora PostgreSQL in real time, so the on-premises database will remain online and accessible during the migration. AWS DMS can also automatically convert the database schema, so there is no need to use AWS SCT.

An Amazon EventBridge rule can be used to monitor the database synchronization and send notifications if any errors occur. This is important because it allows the solutions architect to quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise during the migration.

A database backup of the on-premises database is not necessary because AWS DMS will replicate the data in real time. Creating an ongoing replication task is not necessary because AWS DMS will automatically create an ongoing replication task when the replication server is created.

     A) Create an ongoing replication task

C) Create an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) replication server

The key reasons are:

An ongoing DMS replication task keeps the source and target databases synchronized during the migration.
The DMS replication server manages and executes the replication tasks.
Together, these will continuously replicate changes from on-prem to Aurora to keep them in sync.
A database backup alone wouldn't maintain synchronization.

     Option B ensures that all future notifications are not missed by configuring the AWS account root user email addresses as distribution lists that are monitored by a few administrators. By setting up alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically, the notifications can be sent to the appropriate administrators responsible for monitoring and responding to alerts. This solution allows for centralized management of notifications and ensures they are limited to account administrators.

A. Floods all users with notifications, lacks granularity.
C. Manual forwarding introduces delays, centralizes responsibility.
D. No flexibility for specific account administrators, limits customization.

     "Use a group email address for root user credentials:

Use an email address that is managed by your business and forwards received messages directly to a group of users. If AWS must contact the owner of the account, this approach reduces the risk of delays in responding, even if individuals are on vacation, out sick, or have left the business. The email address used for the root user should not be used for other purposes."

     The reasons are:

Alternate contacts allow defining other users to receive root emails.
Distribution lists ensure multiple admins get notified.
Limits notifications to account admins rather than all users.
Using the same root email address for all accounts (Option D) is not recommended.
Relying on one admin or external forwarding (Options A, C) introduces delays or single points of failure.

     The more aligned answer to this article:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_best-practices_mgmt-acct.html#best-practices_mgmt-acct_email-address

is B.

D would be best if it'd said that the email you configure as "root user email address" will be a distribution list.
The phrase "all future notifications are not missed" points to D, cos' it said:
".. and all newly created accounts to use the same root user email address"
so the future account that will be created will be covered with the business policy.

It's not 100% clear, but I'll choose B.

     Migrating to Amazon MQ reduces the overhead on the queue management. C and D are dismissed.
Deciding between A and B means deciding to go for an AutoScaling group for EC2 or an RDS for Postgress (both multi- AZ). The RDS option has less operational impact, as provide as a service the tools and software required. Consider for instance, the effort to add an additional node like a read replica, to the DB.

     To meet the requirements of providing the highest availability with the least operational overhead, the solutions architect should take the following actions:

* By migrating the queue to Amazon MQ, the architect can take advantage of the built-in high availability and failover capabilities of the service, which will help ensure that messages are delivered reliably and without interruption.

* By creating a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for the EC2 instances that host the application, the architect can ensure that the application is highly available and able to handle increased traffic without the need for manual intervention.

* By migrating the database to a Multi-AZ deployment of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, the architect can take advantage of the built-in high availability and failover capabilities of the service, which will help ensure that the database is always available and able to handle increased traffic.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option B.

     Option B is the best solution to meet the high availability and low overhead requirements:

Migrate the queue to redundant Amazon MQ
Use Auto Scaling groups across AZs for the application
Migrate the database to Multi-AZ RDS PostgreSQL
The reasons are:

Amazon MQ provides a managed, highly available RabbitMQ cluster
Multi-AZ Auto Scaling distributes the application across AZs
RDS PostgreSQL is managed, multi-AZ capable database
Together this architecture removes single points of failure
RDS and MQ reduce operational overhead over self-managed

     Option B provides the highest availability with the least operational overhead. By migrating the queue to a redundant pair of RabbitMQ instances on Amazon MQ, the messaging system becomes highly available. Creating a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances hosting the application ensures that it can automatically scale and maintain availability across multiple Availability Zones. Migrating the database to a Multi-AZ deployment of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL provides automatic failover and data replication across multiple Availability Zones, enhancing availability and reducing operational overhead.

A. Incorrect because it does not address the high availability requirement for the RabbitMQ queue and the PostgreSQL database.

C. Incorrect because it does not provide redundancy for the RabbitMQ queue and does not address the high availability requirement for the PostgreSQL database.

D. Incorrect because it does not address the high availability requirement for the RabbitMQ queue and does not provide redundancy for the application instances.

     i go for D here
A and B says you are copying the file to another bucket using lambda,
C an D just uses S3 replication to copy the files,

They are doing exactly the same thing while C and D do not require setting up of lambda, which should be more efficient

The question says the team is manually copying the files, automatically replicating the files should be the most efficient method vs manually copying or copying with lambda.

       S3 Replication: Configuring S3 replication between the initial and analysis S3 buckets automates the process of moving files between the buckets without the need to manually copy files or run a Lambda function for this purpose. This reduces operational overhead.
S3 Event Notifications: Once files are replicated to the analysis bucket, you can configure S3 event notifications for the s3:ObjectCreated
event. This event triggers actions (such as invoking Lambda functions and sending data to SageMaker Pipelines) when new files are placed in the analysis bucket.
The answer is C

     C and D aren't answers as replicating the S3 bucket isn't efficient, as other teams are starting to use it to store larger docs not related to the reporting, making replication not useful.
As Amazon SageMaker Pipelines, ..., is now supported as a target for routing events in Amazon EventBridge, means the answer is B

       I think you are mis-interpreting the question. I think you need to use all files, including the ones provided by other teams, otherwise how can you tell what files to copy? I think the point of this statement is to show that more files are in use, and being copied at different times, rather than suggesting you need to differentiate between the two sources of files.

         "The reporting team wants to move the files automatically to analysis S3 bucket as the files enter the initial S3 bucket." Replication is asynchronous, with lambda the data will be available faster. So I think A is the answer.

       You misinterpret it ... the reporting team is overload, cos' more teams request their services uploading more data to the bucket. That's the reason reporting team need to automate the process. So ALL the bucket objects need to be copied to other bucket, and the replication is better an cheaper than use Lambda. So the answer is D.

     B is the first option I denied. Since it makes the event happens inside the analysis bucket to trigger the lambda function. so if the lambda function is running code to copy files from initial bucket to analysis bucket. Then this lambda function should be triggered by the event in initial bucket like once the data reaches in the initial bucket then lambda is triggered. D is the answer.

     Utilizing a lambda function would introduce additional operational overhead, eliminating options A and B. S3 replication offers a simpler setup and efficiently accomplishes the task. S3 notifications cannot use SageMaker as a destination; the permissible destinations include SQS, SNS, Lambda, and Eventbridge, so C is out.

     Option D is the solution with the least operational overhead:

Use S3 replication between buckets
Send S3 events to EventBridge
Add Lambda and SageMaker as EventBridge rule targets
The reasons this has the least overhead:

S3 replication automatically copies new objects to analysis bucket
EventBridge allows easily adding multiple targets for events
No custom Lambda function needed for copying objects
Leverages managed services for event processing

     Option D is correct because it combines S3 replication, event notifications, and Amazon EventBridge to automate the copying of files from the initial S3 bucket to the analysis S3 bucket. It also allows for the execution of Lambda functions and integration with SageMaker Pipelines.
Option A is incorrect because it suggests manually copying the files using a Lambda function and event notifications, but it does not utilize S3 replication or EventBridge for automation.
Option B is incorrect because it suggests using S3 event notifications directly with EventBridge, but it does not involve S3 replication or utilize Lambda for copying the files.
Option C is incorrect because it only involves S3 replication and event notifications without utilizing EventBridge or Lambda functions for further processing.

     EC2 instance Savings Plan saves 72% while Compute Savings Plans saves 66%. But according to link, it says "Compute Savings Plans provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs by up to 66%. These plans automatically apply to EC2 instance usage regardless of instance family, size, AZ, region, OS or tenancy, and also apply to Fargate and Lambda usage."

     The two most cost-effective purchasing options for this architecture are:

A) Use Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer

C) Purchase a 1-year Compute Savings Plan for the front end and API layer

The reasons are:

Spot Instances provide the greatest savings for flexible, interruptible EC2 workloads like data ingestion.
Savings Plans offer significant discounts for predictable usage like the front end and API layer.
All Upfront and partial/no Upfront RI's don't align well with the sporadic EC2 usage.
On-Demand is more expensive than Spot for flexible EC2 workloads.
By matching purchasing options to the workload patterns, Spot for unpredictable EC2 and Savings Plans for steady-state usage, the solutions architect optimizes cost efficiency.

     Using Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer will provide the most cost-effective option for sporadic and unpredictable workloads, as Spot Instances offer significant cost savings compared to On-Demand Instances (Option A).

Purchasing a 1-year Compute Savings Plan for the front end and API layer will provide cost savings for predictable utilization over the course of a year (Option C).

Option B is less cost-effective as it suggests using On-Demand Instances for the data ingestion layer, which does not take advantage of cost-saving opportunities.

Option D suggests purchasing 1-year All Upfront Reserved instances for the data ingestion layer, which may not be optimal for sporadic and unpredictable workloads.

Option E suggests purchasing a 1-year EC2 instance Savings Plan for the front end and API layer, but Compute Savings Plans are typically more suitable for predictable workloads.

     To optimize the cost of running this application on AWS, you should consider the following options:

A. Use Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer
C. Purchase a 1-year Compute Savings Plan for the front-end and API layer

Therefore, the most cost-effective solution for hosting this application would be to use Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer and to purchase either a 1-year Compute Savings Plan or a 1-year EC2 instance Savings Plan for the front-end and API layer.

     A,E::
Savings Plan — EC2
Savings Plan offers almost the same savings from a cost as RIs and adds additional Automation around how the savings are being applied. One way to understand is to say that EC2 Savings Plan are Standard Reserved Instances with automatic switching depending on Instance types being used within the same instance family and additionally applied to ECS Fargate and Lambda.

Savings Plan — Compute
Savings Plan offers almost the same savings from a cost as RIs and adds additional Automation around how the savings are being applied. For example, they provide flexibility around instance types and regions so that you don't have to monitor new instance types that are being launched. It is also applied to Lambda and ECS Fargate workloads. One way to understand is to say that Compute Savings Plan are Convertible Reserved Instances with automatic switching depending on Instance types being used.

       Also, option B does not use CloudFront which means all the traffic will go through the internet; So, despite deploying resources in two regions and using the lowest latency point, that public internet connection might probably be slower than a connection through a private aws network as Cloudfront can use.

     Answer should be B,

CloudFront reduces latency if its only static content, which is not the case here.
For Dynamic content, CF cant cache the content so it sends the traffic through the AWS Network which does reduces latency, but it still has to travel through another region.

For the case with 2 region and Route 53 latency routing, Route 53 detects the nearest resouce (with lowest latency) and routes the traffic there. Because the traffic does not have to travel to  resources far away, it should have the least latency in this case here.

       All it takes is for you to go to the Amazon Cloudfront webpage hosted by AWS where it tells you "Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that helps you distribute your static and dynamic content quickly and reliably with high speed".

Answer is A bro. Your answer is B literally makes no sense. Do some studying.

     Ans B - "If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency" ...because it needs to be dynamic: "Latency between hosts on the internet can change over time as a result of changes in network connectivity and routing. Latency-based routing is based on latency measurements taken over a period of time, and the measurements reflect these changes. A request that is routed to the Oregon Region this week might be routed to the Singapore Region next week."

     With Amazon CloudFront, your end users connections are terminated at CloudFront locations closer to them, which helps in reducing the overall round trip time required to establish a connection. This is irrespective of static a dynamic content.

     You can still have improved performance by distributing the dynamic traffic through CDN instead of ALB. Refer below link. 
Also for other 2 options, using just 2 other regions for world wide distribution doesn't make much of a sense.

     CloudFront for Static Content: By leveraging Amazon CloudFront, static content such as images, stylesheets, and scripts can be cached and distributed globally across a network of edge locations. This ensures that users receive static content from the nearest edge location, reducing latency and improving performance.

Serve Dynamic Content from ALB: Since dynamic content requires real-time processing and cannot be effectively cached at edge locations, serving dynamic content directly from the Application Load Balancer (ALB) is appropriate. The ALB can handle dynamic requests efficiently within the AWS Region where the application is deployed.

     I choose option B.

While CloudFront can accelerate content delivery by caching static content at edge locations, it may not be the most effective solution in this scenario. Since the portal delivers a mixture of static and dynamic content, leveraging Route 53 latency routing for dynamic content delivery ensures that users are directed to the nearest AWS Region hosting the dynamic content.

     "Least amount of latency for all users" "across the world" = CloudFront, thus B and D are out. Also, deploying the stack in "two regions" would benefit those two regions, but not users "across the world".

     Answer is option A:
Earth Networks uses a CDN so that they can provide dynamic and personalized web based content quickly to their users with very low latency and high performing response times. Specifically, they need to be able to provide local information to the end user, in near real time, and need a CDN that allows them to adjust things like time to live, query strings, and cookie information so that they can pass all that information back to the origin to pull just what the user needs.

     Option D is the most suitable choice for minimizing latency for all users. It leverages the use of multiple AWS regions, geolocation routing, and the ALB to ensure that users are directed to the closest region, reducing latency for both static and dynamic content. This approach provides a high level of availability and performance for global users.

     The solution that will ensure the LEAST amount of latency for all users is:

A. Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve all static and dynamic content by specifying the ALB as an origin.

Here's why:

Option A (Single AWS Region, Amazon CloudFront for both static and dynamic content):

Deploying the application stack in a single AWS Region helps reduce complexity and potential data synchronization issues that might arise from using multiple regions

     Correct Answer: C 
AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

     The correct answer is Option C. To meet the requirements;

* AWS Global Accelerator is a service that routes traffic to the nearest edge location, providing low latency and static IP addresses for the front-end tier. It supports UDP-based traffic, which is required by the application.

* A Network Load Balancer is a layer 4 load balancer that can handle UDP traffic and provide static IP addresses for the application endpoints.

* An EC2 Auto Scaling group ensures that the required number of Amazon EC2 instances is available to meet the demand of the application. This will help the front-end tier to provide the best possible user experience.

Option A is not a valid solution because Amazon Route 53 does not support UDP traffic.
Option B is not a valid solution because Amazon CloudFront does not support UDP traffic.
Option D is not a valid solution because Amazon API Gateway does not support UDP traffic.

     AWS Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses that serve as a fixed entry point to application endpoints. This allows optimal routing to the nearest edge location.
Using a Network Load Balancer (NLB) allows support for UDP traffic, as NLBs can handle TCP and UDP protocols.
The application runs on a modified Linux kernel, so using Amazon EC2 instances directly will provide the needed customization and low latency.
The EC2 instances can be auto scaled based on demand to provide high availability.
API Gateway and Application Load Balancer are more suited for HTTP/HTTPS and REST API type workloads. For a UDP gaming workload, Global Accelerator + NLB + EC2 is a better architectural fit.

     AWS Global Accelerator is designed to improve the availability and performance of applications by routing traffic through the AWS global network to the nearest edge locations, reducing latency. By configuring AWS Global Accelerator to forward requests to a Network Load Balancer, UDP-based traffic can be efficiently distributed across multiple EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. Using Amazon EC2 instances for the application allows for customization of the Linux kernel and support for UDP-based traffic. This solution provides static IP addresses for entry into the application endpoints, ensuring consistent access for users.

Option A suggests using AWS Lambda for the application, but Lambda is not suitable for long-running UDP-based applications and may not provide the required low latency.
Option B suggests using CloudFront, which is primarily designed for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and does not have native support for UDP-based traffic.
Option D suggests using API Gateway, which is primarily used for RESTful APIs and does not support UDP-based traffic.

     D is organic pattern, lift and shift, decompose to containers, first making most use of existing code, whilst new features can be added over time with lambda+api gw later.
A is leapfrog pattern. requiring refactoring all code up front.

     For the folks suggesting Amplify: Have any of you actually shipped anything on Amplify? There are tons of adaptations needed to port a monolith to Amplify, specially around the backend that will need severe refactor.
Answer D allows for decomposing the application into different containers, enabling a distributed monolith.

     B allows for a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda functions, which are highly scalable and require minimal operational overhead. AWS Amplify can help in managing the front-end code, while Amazon API Gateway integrated with AWS Lambda can handle the backend services.

D imo is not the best option in this scenario. While ECS can be a good choice for containerized workloads, it might introduce more operational overhead compared to a serverless solution like AWS Lambda and AWS Amplify.

     I have a problem with this question. 
"The company wants to keep as much of the front-end code and the backend code as possible"
So containerization is the solution here (D)? ABC don't make much sense so I will go with D but using containers for FE/BE code and configuring ALB for ECS (hopefully for frontend containers) is a pain in practice. Maybe this is worded in a bad way.

     The reasons are:

ECS allows running Docker containers, so the existing monolithic app can be containerized and run on ECS with minimal code changes.
The app can be broken into smaller microservices by containerizing different components and managing them separately.
ECS provides auto scaling capabilities to scale each microservice independently.
Using an Application Load Balancer with ECS enables distributing traffic across containers and auto scaling.
ECS has minimal operational overhead compared to managing EC2 instances directly.
Serverless options like Lambda and API Gateway would require significant code refactoring which is not ideal for migrating an existing app.

     Honestly, from my experience, the minimal operational overhead is with Amplify and API Gateway with lambdas. Both services have neat release features, you do not need to fiddle around ECS configurations as everything is server-less, which is also highly scalable. Eventhough it is much harder to refactor monolithic app to this set-up it is definitely easier to operate. Not talking about complexities around ALB.

       I actually agree with this, they have a monolithic application that contains the Front-end and Back-end. They clearly state they want different teams managing different applications. This is telling me they want a team to manage the front-end and a team to manage the back-end. A,C and D suggest simply running copies of the monolith application (containing front and back end). So how will different teams manage different applications?? B is the only one that actually splits front and back end

     ECS provides a highly scalable and managed environment for running containerized applications, reducing operational overhead. By setting up an ALB with ECS as the target, traffic can be distributed across multiple instances of the application for scalability and availability. This solution enables different teams to manage each application independently, promoting team autonomy and efficient development.

A is more suitable for event-driven and serverless workloads. It may not be the ideal choice for migrating a monolithic application and maintaining the existing codebase.

B integrates with Lambda and API Gateway, it may not provide the required flexibility for breaking the application into smaller applications and managing them independently.

C would involve managing the infrastructure and scaling manually. It may result in higher operational overhead compared to using a container service like ECS.

     Option B: Migrating the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica may be the most cost-effective solution because it involves creating a read-only copy of the database that can be used specifically for running large reports without impacting the performance of the primary database. This solution allows the company to scale the read capacity of the database without incurring additional hardware or I/O costs.

       The incorrect solutions are:

Option A: Migrating the monthly reporting to Amazon Redshift may not be cost-effective because it involves creating a new data store and potentially significant data migration and ETL costs.

Option C: Migrating the Aurora database to a larger instance class may not be cost-effective because it involves changing the underlying hardware of the database and potentially incurring additional costs for the larger instance.

Option D: Increasing the Provisioned IOPS on the Aurora instance may not be cost-effective because it involves paying for additional I/O capacity that may not be necessary for other workloads on the database.

     Aurora Replicas utilize the same storage as the primary instance so there is no additional storage cost.
Replicas can be created and destroyed easily to match reporting needs.
The primary Aurora instance size does not need to be changed, avoiding additional cost.
Workload is offloaded from the primary instance, improving its performance.
No major software/configuration changes needed compared to options like Redshift.

     I don't understand why doubling everything (instances, network cost, maintenance effort, and especially storage) can be considered "cost-saving" for a simple monthly report...
An instance upgrade can very well be much cheaper. This question is very vague and does not provide enough information.

     B is correct because migrating the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica can offload the reporting workload from the primary Aurora instance, reducing the impact on its performance during large reports. Using an Aurora Replica provides scalability and allows the replica to handle the read-intensive reporting queries, improving the overall performance of the ecommerce application.

A is wrong because migrating to Amazon Redshift introduces additional costs and complexity, and it may not be necessary to switch to a separate data warehousing service for this specific issue.

C is wrong because simply increasing the instance class of the Aurora database may not be the most cost-effective solution if the performance issue can be resolved by offloading the reporting workload to an Aurora Replica.

D is wrong because increasing the Provisioned IOPS alone may not address the issue of spikes in CPUUtilization during large reports, as it primarily focuses on storage performance rather than overall database performance.

An Aurora Replica is a read-only copy of an Aurora database that is updated in real-time with the primary database.

     I was tempted to pick A but then I realized there are two key requirements:
- scale seamlessly
- cost-effectively

None of A-C give seamless scalability. A and B are about adding second instance (which I assume does not match to "scale seamlessly"). C is about changing instance type.

Therefore D is only workable solution to the scalability requirement

       It is spot fleet - not spot instances. They can include On-Demand instances and can also maintain the target capacity automatically.
----
A Spot Fleet is a set of Spot Instances and optionally On-Demand Instances that is launched based on criteria that you specify. The Spot Fleet selects the Spot capacity pools that meet your needs and launches Spot Instances to meet the target capacity for the fleet. By default, Spot Fleets are set to maintain target capacity by launching replacement instances after Spot Instances in the fleet are terminated.

     The key reasons are:

Migrating the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL provides a scalable, high performance database to support the application.
Creating an AMI of the web application and using it in an Auto Scaling group with Spot instances allows cheap and efficient scaling of the web tier.
The Application Load Balancer distributes traffic across the Auto Scaling group.
Spot instances in an Auto Scaling group allow cost-optimized automatic scaling based on demand.
This approach provides high availability and seamless scaling without manual intervention.

     D is correct because migrating the database to Amazon Aurora provides better scalability and performance compared to Amazon RDS for MySQL. Creating an AMI of the web application allows for easy replication of the application on multiple instances. Using a launch template and Auto Scaling group with Spot Fleet provides cost optimization by leveraging spot instances. Adding an Application Load Balancer ensures the load is distributed across the instances for seamless scaling.

A is incorrect because using an Application Load Balancer with multiple EC2 instances is a better approach for scalability compared to relying on a single instance.

B is incorrect because weighted routing in Amazon Route 53 distributes traffic based on fixed weights, which may not dynamically adjust to the changing load.

C is incorrect because using AWS Lambda to stop and change the instance type based on CPU utilization is not an efficient way to handle scaling for a web application. Auto Scaling is a better approach for dynamic scaling.

     the options that said "launch a second EC2", have no sense ... why 2?, why not 3 or 4 or 5?
so options A and B drop.
C is no sense (Lambda doing this like a Scaling Group?, absurd)
Has to be D. Little extrange cos' Aurora is a very good solution, but NOT CHEAP (remember: cost-effectively).
To be honest, the most cost-effectively is B je je

     Answer is B: Reserved is cheaper than on demand the company has.  And it's meet the availabilty (HA) requirement as to spot instance that can be disrupted at any time.
PRICING BELOW.
On-Demand:     0%	There's no commitment from you. You pay the most with this option.
Reserved :  40%-60%1-year or 3-year commitment from you. You save money from that commitment.
Spot	50%-90%	Ridiculously inexpensive because there's no commitment from the AWS side.

     This is a bit unclear, but B seems the best option of the ones given.

Usage is either "heavy" (during the 8 hours), "moderate and steady" (overnight) or "low" (during weekends). So there is always SOME usage, which could be covered by a few Reserved Instances (which would be cheaper than On-Demand Instances).

A - "Spot instances for the entire workload", might 'affect the availability of the application'
B - Seems the best answer
C - More expensive than B
D - Dedicated instances aka dedicated hardware -&gt; very expensive

     I vote for C:
Please explain me if I am wrong:
If application experiences heavy usage during an 8-hour period each business day and all other time we don't need them? it mean than on-demand price will be only 33% from total cost so saving will be near 66%, more than reserved instances all other load we can cover by spot instances.
So why it not C?

     The answer should be C. Because if reserved is chosen, you have to pay for every hour. I calculate from this pages (if I'm wrong please correct me) https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/pricing/#:~:text=Reserved%20Instances%20provide%20you%20with,instances%20when%20you%20need%20them.
 Example:  for t4g.nano
Reserved instances (0.003X24X365)+(1.90X12)=49.08
On demand instance (0.0042X8X365)=12.264
it will be added spot instances

       The statelessness of a web application does not necessarily mean that it's okay to be interrupted. Statelessness refers to how the application handles requests and manages session data, not its ability to handle interruptions.

     If we assume moderate usage of 8 hours on average every day a week, this should be on demand, since it is not a 24/7 server. There is downtime on the weekends and after the initial 8 hours.

     I see some internet post about On-Demand vs Reserved below. I also think the argument from the (C) camp is valid. But (B) is not wrong. Just depends on usage.
quoted from: https://www.pcapps.com/services/aws-reserved-vs-on-demand-instances/
If you know you are only going to use a particular server part-time – say, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week – we recommend purchasing On-Demand Instances for those servers. If you are unsure which instance type is most appropriate for your performance needs, our advice is to start with any On-Demand Instance for a month or two, and experiment with changing the Instance Type up or down to see it performs. The goal is to “dial into” the lowest cost instance type that meets your performance needs. We recommend that you purchase Reserved Instances only when you know you are going to use it close to 24×7 (or at least more than 75% of the time).

     Why not AwsBackup? No Glacier Deep is supported by AWS Backup

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/s3-backups.html 
AWS Backup allows you to backup your S3 data stored in the following S3 Storage Classes:
•	S3 Standard
•	S3 Standard - Infrequently Access (IA)
•	S3 One Zone-IA
•	S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
•	S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 INT)

     B is the most cost-effective solution. Storing the logs in S3 and using S3 Lifecycle policies to transition logs older than 1 month to S3 Glacier Deep Archive allows for cost optimization based on data access patterns. Since logs older than 1 month are rarely accessed, moving them to S3 Glacier Deep Archive helps minimize storage costs while still retaining the logs for the required 10-year period.

A is incorrect because using AWS Backup to move logs to S3 Glacier Deep Archive can incur additional costs and complexity compared to using S3 Lifecycle policies directly.

C adds unnecessary complexity and costs by involving CloudWatch Logs and AWS Backup when direct management through S3 is sufficient.

D is incorrect because using S3 Lifecycle policies to move logs from CloudWatch Logs to S3 Glacier Deep Archive is not a valid option. CloudWatch Logs and S3 have separate storage mechanisms, and S3 Lifecycle policies cannot be applied directly to CloudWatch Logs.

     Option B (Store the logs in Amazon S3. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move logs more than 1-month-old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive) would meet these requirements in the most cost-effective manner.

This solution would allow the application team to quickly access the logs from the past month for troubleshooting, while also providing a cost-effective storage solution for the logs that are rarely accessed and need to be retained for 10 years.

     To ensure that all notifications are eventually processed, the best solution would be to configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue as the on-failure destination for the SNS topic. This will allow the notifications to be retried until they are successfully processed. The Lambda function can then be modified to process messages in the queue, ensuring that all notifications are eventually processed. Option D, "Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the on-failure destination. Modify the Lambda function to process messages in the queue," is the correct answer.

     I choose Option D as the correct answer.

To ensure that all notifications are eventually processed, the solutions architect can set up an Amazon SQS queue as the on-failure destination for the Amazon SNS topic. This way, when the Lambda function fails due to network connectivity issues, the notification will be sent to the queue instead of being lost. The Lambda function can then be modified to process messages in the queue, ensuring that all notifications are eventually processed.

     Option C is right option. 
SNS does not have any "On Failure" delivery destination. One need to configure dead-letter queue and configure SQS to read from there.  So given this option D is incorrect.

       I don't think that's right 
"A dead-letter queue is an Amazon SQS queue that an Amazon SNS subscription can target for messages that can't be delivered to subscribers successfully. Messages that can't be delivered due to client errors or server errors are held in the dead-letter queue for further analysis or reprocessing" from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-dead-letter-queues.html.
This is pretty much what is being described in D.
Plus C will only retry message processing, and network problems could still prevent the message from being processed, but the question states "ensure that all notifications are eventually processed". So C does not meet the requirements but D does look to do this.

     A is the correct solution. By creating an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue to hold messages and setting up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue, the company can ensure that the order of the event data is maintained throughout processing. SQS FIFO queues guarantee the order of messages and are suitable for scenarios where strict message ordering is required.

B is incorrect because Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics are not designed to preserve message order. SNS is a publish-subscribe messaging service and does not guarantee the order of message delivery.

C is incorrect because using an SQS standard queue does not guarantee the order of message processing. SQS standard queues provide high throughput and scale, but they do not guarantee strict message ordering.

D is incorrect because configuring an SQS queue as a subscriber to an SNS topic does not ensure message ordering. SNS topics distribute messages to subscribers independently, and the order of message processing is not guaranteed.

     Composite alarms determine their states by monitoring the states of other alarms. You can **use composite alarms to reduce alarm noise**. For example, you can create a composite alarm where the underlying metric alarms go into ALARM when they meet specific conditions. You then can set up your composite alarm to go into ALARM and send you notifications when the underlying metric alarms go into ALARM by configuring the underlying metric alarms never to take actions. Currently, composite alarms can take the following actions:

     By creating composite alarms in CloudWatch, the solutions architect can combine multiple metrics, such as CPU utilization and read IOPS, into a single alarm. This allows the company to take action only when both conditions are met, reducing false alarms and focusing on meaningful alerts.

B can help in monitoring the overall health and performance of the application. However, it does not directly address the specific requirement of triggering an action when CPU utilization and read IOPS exceed certain thresholds simultaneously.

C. Creating CloudWatch Synthetics canaries is useful for actively monitoring the application's behavior and availability. However, it does not directly address the specific requirement of monitoring CPU utilization and read IOPS to trigger an action.

D. Creating single CloudWatch metric alarms with multiple metric thresholds where possible can be an option, but it does not address the requirement of triggering an action only when both CPU utilization and read IOPS exceed their respective thresholds simultaneously.

     With CloudWatch, you can combine several alarms into one composite alarm to create a summarized, aggregated health indicator over a whole application or group of resources. Composite alarms are alarms that determine their state by monitoring the states of other alarms. You define rules to combine the status of those monitored alarms using Boolean logic.

     The key reasons are:

Composite alarms allow defining alarms with multiple metrics and conditions, like high CPU AND high read IOPS in this case.
Composite alarms can avoid false positives triggered by a single metric spike.
Dashboards help visualize but won't take automated action. Synthetics tests application availability but doesn't address the metrics.
Single metric alarms with multiple thresholds can't correlate across metrics and may still trigger false positives.
Composite alarms allow acting quickly when both CPU and IOPS are high, per the stated need.

     Option A, creating Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms, is correct because it allows the solutions architect to create an alarm that is triggered only when both CPU utilization is above 50% and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time. This meets the requirement to act as soon as possible if both conditions are met, while also reducing the number of false alarms by ensuring that the alarm is triggered only when both conditions are met.

       The incorrect solutions are:

In contrast, Option B, creating Amazon CloudWatch dashboards, would not directly address the requirement to trigger an alarm when both CPU utilization is high and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time. Dashboards can be useful for visualizing metric data and identifying trends, but they do not have the capability to trigger alarms based on multiple metric thresholds.

Option C, using Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics canaries, may not be the best choice for this scenario, as canaries are used for synthetic testing rather than for monitoring live traffic. Canaries can be useful for monitoring the availability and performance of an application, but they may not be the most effective way to monitor the specific metric thresholds and conditions described in this scenario.

         Option D, creating single Amazon CloudWatch metric alarms with multiple metric thresholds, would not allow the solutions architect to create an alarm that is triggered only when both CPU utilization and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time. Instead, the alarm would be triggered whenever any of the specified metric thresholds are exceeded, which may result in a higher number of false alarms.

     The AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm type creates or updates a composite alarm. When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.

The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms and other composite alarms.Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise.

     A. By using Control Tower, the company can enforce data residency guardrails and restrict internet access for VPCs and denies access to all Regions except the required ap-northeast-3 Region.

C. With Organizations, the company can configure SCPs to prevent VPCs from gaining internet access. By denying access to all Regions except ap-northeast-3, the company ensures that VPCs can only be deployed in the specified Region.

Option B is incorrect because using rules in AWS WAF alone does not address the requirement of denying access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3.

Option D is incorrect because configuring outbound rules in network ACLs and IAM policies for users can help restrict traffic and access, but it does not enforce the company's requirement of denying access to all Regions except ap-northeast-3.

Option E is incorrect because using AWS Config and managed rules can help detect and alert for specific resources and configurations, but it does not directly enforce the restriction of internet access or deny access to specific Regions.

For control tower, it can't be A because ap-northeast-3 doesn't support it!
Also, in the case of E, it is detection and warning, so it is difficult to prevent internet connection (although the view is a little obscure).

B- for sure no 
C - SCPS (Service Control Policies)- For sure 
D - Deny outbound rule to be place in prod and also IAM Policy to deny Users creating services in AP-Northeast3
E - it creates an alert, which means it happens but an alert is triggered. so I think it's not good either.

       Denying access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3 in the AWS account settings cannot be enforced. Each individual account owner would have to configure this on trust. They could easily change it to allow themselves access beyond the Asia Pacific Region. 

So, instead you configure access controls across ALL accounts by using service control policies (SCPs). Apply to the root &amp; it will apply to all OUs and accounts in the organization.

     A is true for sure. "Schedule Amazon RDS stop and start using AWS Systems Manager" Steps in the documentation:
	1. Configure an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy for State Manager.
	2. Create an IAM role for the new policy.
	3. Update the trust relationship of the role so Systems Manager can use it.
	4. Set up the automatic stop with State Manager.
	5. Set up the automatic start with State Manager.

       (A) &amp; (D) both look correct &amp; both are supported by a 2-part article. First part describes (D), the second (A). 

I don't have an issue with (A): Session vs State; I understand that State Manager is a capability of Systems Manager.
Because Lambda is not free beyond the free-tier limit &amp; (A) is more complete with IAM notes unlike (D), I would choose (A) on the exam.

       While the instance is stopped, you're charged for storage and backups, but not for the DB instance hours.

     Although both A and D is a workable solution, the requirements is to minimum cost.

The benefits of automating the startup and shutdown of RDS DB instances using Lambda allows organizations to further reduce compute costs and simplify the administration of database environments that don't need to be running continuously.

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/schedule-amazon-rds-stop-and-start-using-aws-lambda/

For using system manager to accomplish the task works however keep in mind that although we're stopping the databases, the storage costs for the databases still apply.

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/schedule-amazon-rds-stop-and-start-using-aws-systems-manager/

Initially I also thought that A would be the correct answer however looking at the administration and cost I would go for D as a better solution instead.

     To automatically shutdown an RDS instance during 09:00 PM to 09:00 AM and have it available between 09:00 AM to 09:00 PM, you can use AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows.

Create two Maintenance Windows - one to stop the RDS instance at 09:00 PM and another to start it at 09:00 AM.

For each Maintenance Window, select the "AWS-StopRDSInstance" and "AWS-StartRDSInstance" runbooks respectively and specify the cron expression for the schedule.

Tag the RDS instance with a name so it can be identified by the runbooks.

The runbooks will then automatically stop and start the RDS instance on the specified schedule without needing any manual intervention.

       This allows cost savings by shutting down the RDS instance during non-business hours while keeping it available during the day as per your requirements. Refer to the AWS documentation for more details on configuring Maintenance Windows and runbooks.

     AWS Lambda functions can be used to start and stop RDS instances programmatically.
EventBridge scheduled rules can trigger the Lambda functions at specified times daily.
This allows fully automating the starting and stopping of RDS on a schedule to match usage patterns.
RDS billing is per hour when instance is running, so stopping when not in use significantly reduces costs.
Using Lambda and EventBridge is simpler and more robust than cron jobs on EC2.
ElastiCache and Systems Manager Session Manager are useful tools but do not directly address scheduled RDS start/stop.

     By using AWS Lambda functions triggered by Amazon EventBridge scheduled rules, the company can automate the start and stop actions for the Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance based on the 12-hour access period. This allows them to minimize costs by only running the DB instance when it is needed.

Option A is not the most suitable solution because it refers to IAM policies for AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, which is primarily used for interactive shell access to EC2 instances and does not directly address the requirement of starting and stopping the DB instance.

Option B is not the most suitable solution because it suggests using Amazon ElastiCache for Redis as a cache cluster, which may not provide the desired cost optimization for the DB instance.

Option C is not the most suitable solution because launching an EC2 instance and configuring cron jobs to start and stop it does not directly address the requirement of minimizing costs for the Amazon RDS DB instance.

     In a typical development environment, dev and test databases are mostly utilized for 8 hours a day and sit idle when not in use. However, the databases are billed for the compute and storage costs during this idle time. To reduce the overall cost, Amazon RDS allows instances to be stopped temporarily. While the instance is stopped, you're charged for storage and backups, but not for the DB instance hours. Please note that a stopped instance will automatically be started after 7 days.

This post presents a solution using AWS Lambda and Amazon EventBridge that allows you to schedule a Lambda function to stop and start the idle databases with specific tags to save on compute costs. The second post presents a solution that accomplishes stop and start of the idle Amazon RDS databases using AWS Systems Manager.

     Answer D
Why Optoin D ?
The Question talks about downloads are infrequent older than 90 days which means files less than 90 days are accessed frequently. Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) needs a minimum 30 days if accessed before, it costs more.
So to access the files frequently you need a  S3 Standard .  After 90 days you can move it to  Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) as its going to be less frequently accessed

       I do not agree. The MOST cheaper option is B, because by choosing:
D) Files older than 90 days will live eternally in the S3 Infrequently access layer at $0.0125/GB.
B) Using Intelligent-Tiering files older than 90 days can be moved DIRECTLY to the "Archive access tier" (Glacier instant retrieval) at $0.004/GB, avoiding/skipping the "S3 Infrequently access layer". The question also seems to be according this assuption as says "and configure it to move objects to a less expensive storage tier after 90 days".

           Archive Instant Access tier (automatic)
If an object is not accessed for 90 consecutive days, the object moves to the Archive Instant Access tier. The Archive Instant Access tier provides low latency and high-throughput performance. --- This says it moves to instant retrieval class. Price for this is lesser than standard IA. Answer should be B

There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. S3 Intelligent-Tiering has no minimum eligible object size, but objects smaller than 128 KB are not eligible for auto tiering. These smaller objects may be stored, but they'll always be charged at the Frequent Access tier

     I am going with D instead of B because Intelligent-Tiering may work against you in this case.  The company knows that the files are rarely accessed after 90 days.  So even if a file is accessed on the 89th day, they would still want to "archive" that file the next day (again because they fully know the typical access behavior).   However, Intelligent Tiering will reset the 90-day inactive clock starting on the 89th day (i.e. it will not archive the file until the 189th day assuming no other access).

     You can't configure Intelligent Tiering, that is the whole point of it. It's intelligent and moves things on its own so there is no 90 day configuration you can set.
Therefore D is the answer.

Also the 128KB size is perfect for Intelligent Tiering.

     I think this is a kind of tricky question (B VS D) However:
The Q stated "most accessed files readily available for its users."
From this and correct me if I am wrong, I think B is a better solution since Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering working on "moving data to the most cost-effective access tier based on access frequency" while the S3 Standard-IA doesn't.

     B. Move the files to S3 Intelligent-Tiering and configure it to move objects to a less expensive storage tier after 90 days.

Explanation:

S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves objects between two access tiers: frequent access and infrequent access, based on access patterns.
By configuring S3 Intelligent-Tiering to move objects to a less expensive storage tier after 90 days of infrequent access, the company can save money on storage costs while ensuring that the most accessed files remain readily available.
This approach is more cost-effective than using S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) because it automatically adjusts storage tiers based on access patterns without the need for manual configuration or management.

     D is cheapest and managed by S3 Lifecycle policy
A: Not readily available
C: Wrong product
B: No choice of '90 days' so you'll be paying for Intelligent Tiering unnecessarily for files to drop out of frequent access after the first 90 days.

     The key reasons:

S3 Lifecycle policies can automatically transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-IA after 90 days.
S3 Standard provides high performance for frequently accessed newer files.
S3 Standard-IA costs 20-30% less than S3 Standard for infrequently accessed files.
This matches access patterns - high performance for new files, cost savings for older files.
S3 Intelligent Tiering has higher request costs and complexity for this simple access pattern.
S3 Inventory lists objects and their properties but does not directly transition objects.
Lifecycle policies provide automated transitions without manual intervention.

     Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) has a minimum billable object size, which currently is 128KB. This means that even if the stored object is smaller than 128KB, Amazon S3 will charge for a minimum of 128KB of data.

     Very tricky case. Besides all the arguments for both camps. I lean to (B). There is an article about the adoption of Intelligent-Tiering in the recent years to save money. Had the following text is "all files ready", I would picked (D):  keeping the most accessed files readily available . for its users.   I hope AWS gives "partial credit" for both (B) and (D) regardless which is the MOST cost-effective.

       How do you 'configure Intelligent Tiering to move objects to a less expensive storage tier after 90 days'? It's called "intelligent" because it moves files intelligently, not after a schedule you specify.

         S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and automatically moves objects to the Infrequent Access tier when they haven't been accessed for 30 consecutive days. After 90 days of no access, the objects are moved to the Archive Instant Access tier without performance impact or operational overhead.

     Implement an S3 Lifecycle policy that moves the objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-1A) after 90 days.

I would not try to overthink this.

     B,
The key is "No users can have the ability to modify or delete any files" and compliance mode supports that.
I remember it this way: ( governance is like government, they set the rules but they can allow some people to break it :D )

       Amazon S3 Object Lock
1. Governance mode - Only users with special permissions can overwrite, delete, or alter object ock settings
2. Compliance mode - No user, including the root user in an AWS account, can overwrite, delete, or alter object lock settings

     Answer : B
Reason: Compliance Mode. The key difference between Compliance Mode and Governance Mode is that there are NO users that can override the retention periods set or delete an object, and that also includes your AWS root account which has the highest privileges.

     First of all, Regal hold has no expiration before you remove it. So A makes no sense.
After that Governance mode is breakable with permission, but Compilance mode is not even for root user cannot delete it.

       Legal hold – A legal hold provides the same protection as a retention period, but it HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE. Instead, a legal hold remains in place until you explicitly remove it. Legal holds are independent from retention periods and are PLACED ON INDIVIDUAL OBJECT VERSIONS.

     Unsure, B would meet the "must keep every file for a minimum of 1 year" requirement. (In theory C would too if you ignore the root user, but administrators could remove the policy.) But what about the 'a few scientists must be able to add new files'? None of the options mentions permissions for a special group.

     Both Compliance &amp; Governance mode protect objects against being deleted or changed. But in Governance mode some people can have special permissions. In this question, no user can delete or modify files; so the answer is Compliance mode only. Neither of these modes restrict user from adding new files.

     Compliance Mode best suits this scenario because once an object is locked in compliance mode, its retention mode can't be changed, and its retention period can't be shortened.

- Scientists add new files &amp; other users read-only access.
- Keep files for a minimum of 1 year
Only option B allows to:
- Disable all users the ability to modify or delete any file.
If A) were the correct option some scientis will be able to modify files, as if they were in charge of put an object lock same permission would allow them to remove the lock and consequently delete the file.

     S3 Object Lock provides the necessary features to enforce immutability and retention of objects in an S3. Compliance mode ensures that the locked objects cannot be deleted or modified by any user, including those with write access. By setting a retention period of 365 days, the company can ensure that every file in the repository is kept for a minimum of 1 year after its creation date.

A does not provide the same level of protection as compliance mode. In governance mode, there is a possibility for authorized users to remove the legal hold, potentially allowing objects to be modified or deleted.

C can restrict users from deleting or changing objects, but it does not enforce the retention period requirement. It also does not provide the same level of immutability and protection against accidental or malicious modifications.

D does not address the requirement of preventing users from modifying or deleting files. It provides a mechanism for tracking changes but does not enforce the desired access restrictions or retention period.

     In compliance mode, a protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account. When an object is locked in compliance mode, its retention mode can't be changed, and its retention period can't be shortened. Compliance mode helps ensure that an object version can't be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the retention period.
In governance mode, users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions. With governance mode, you protect objects against being deleted by most users, but you can still grant some users permission to alter the retention settings or delete the object if necessary. 
In Governance mode, Objects can be deleted by some users with special permissions, this is against the requirement.

     The reasons are:

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations around the world.
Connecting the S3 buckets containing the media files to CloudFront will cache the content at global edge locations.
This provides fast reliable access to users everywhere by serving content from the nearest edge location.
CloudFront integrates tightly with S3 for secure, durable storage.
Global Accelerator improves availability and performance for TCP/UDP traffic, not HTTP-based content delivery.
DataSync and SQS are not technologies for a global CDN like CloudFront.

     CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by AWS. It caches content at edge locations worldwide, allowing users to access the content quickly regardless of their geographic location. By connecting the S3 to CloudFront, the media files can be cached at edge locations, ensuring reliable and fast delivery to users.

A. is a data transfer service that is not designed for caching or content delivery. It is used for transferring data between on-premises storage systems and AWS services.

B. is a service that improves the performance and availability of applications for global users. While it can provide fast and reliable access, it is not specifically designed for caching media files or connecting directly to S3.

D. is a message queue service that is not suitable for caching or content delivery. It is used for decoupling and coordinating message-based communication between different components of an application.

Therefore, the correct solution is option C, deploying CloudFront to connect the S3 to CloudFront edge servers.

     The reasons are:

AWS Lake Formation and Glue provide automated data lake creation with minimal coding. Glue crawlers identify sources and ETL jobs load to S3.
Athena allows ad-hoc queries directly on S3 data with no infrastructure to manage.
QuickSight provides easy cloud BI for dashboards.
Options C and D require significant custom coding for ETL and queries.
Redshift and OpenSearch would require additional setup and management overhead.

     It combines data from database and stream data, so data lake needs to be used.
And it wants to do one time query, so Athena is better.

     The Apache Parquet format is a performance-oriented, column-based data format designed for storage and retrieval. It is generally faster for reads than writes because of its columnar storage layout and a pre-computed schema that is written with the data into the files. AWS Glue's Parquet writer offers fast write performance and flexibility to handle evolving datasets. You can use AWS Glue to read Parquet files from Amazon S3 and from streaming sources as well as write Parquet files to Amazon S3. When using AWS Glue to build a data lake foundation, it automatically crawls your Amazon S3 data, identifies data formats, and then suggests schemas for use with other AWS analytic services[1][2][3][4].

     ANSWER - AE:Amazon Athena is the best choice for running one-time queries on streaming data. Although Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics provides an easy and familiar standard SQL language to analyze streaming data in real-time, it is designed for continuous queries rather than one-time queries[1]. On the other hand, Amazon Athena is a serverless interactive query service that allows querying data in Amazon S3 using SQL. It is optimized for ad-hoc querying and is ideal for running one-time queries on streaming data[2].AWS Lake Formation uses as a central place to have all your data for analytics purposes (E). Athena integrate perfect with S3 and can makes queries (A).

     can anyone help me in below question
36.	A company has a Java application that uses Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) to parse messages. The application cannot parse messages that are large on 256KB size. The company wants to implement a solution to give the application the ability to parse messages as large as 50 MB.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the FEWEST changes to the code?
a)	Use the Amazon SOS Extended Client Library for Java to host messages that are larger than 256 KB in Amazon S3.
b)	Use Amazon EventBridge to post large messages from the application instead of Aaron SOS
c)	Change the limit in Amazon SQS to handle messages that are larger than 256 KB
d)	Store messages that are larger than 256 KB in Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Configure Amazon  SQS to reference this location in the messages.

     I'd say "A" over "E" because in the option "E", it says use AWS Backup to take the "backups" not snapshot. "If you use AWS CLI, this is set using the parameter DeleteAfterDays. The retention period for snapshots can range between 1 day and 100 years (or indefinitely if you don't enter one), while the retention period for continuous backups can range from 1 day to 35 days. The creation date of a backup is the date the backup job started, not the date it completed. If your backup job doesn't complete on the same date it started, use the date on which it began to help calculate retention periods."

     My thoughts:
1. AWS backups is designed to make back ups 
2. "configure backup retention for 5 years" with what? a script? maybe AWS backups???? are the back ups done with DD and stored in S3? i cannot trust this answer
3. "Take a manual snapshot of the DB cluster" this is not an amazon best practice they want us to use their tools AWS backups
4. "create a life cycle policy" assuming the back ups are stored in S3 (which is not a best practice) cannot trust this

that leaves D and E

     The reasons are:

Configuring the automated backups for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to retain backups for 5 years will meet the requirement to store all data for that duration.
Exporting the database logs to CloudWatch Logs will capture the audit logs of actions performed in the database. CloudWatch Logs retention can be configured to store logs indefinitely.
This meets the need to keep audit logs available beyond the 5 year data retention period.
Additional manual snapshots or using AWS Backup for backups is not necessary since automated backups are already enabled.
A lifecycle policy is useful for transitioning storage classes but does not apply here for a set 5 year retention.

     Previously, you had to create custom scripts to automate backup scheduling, enforce retention policies, or consolidate backup activity for manual Aurora cluster snapshots, especially when coordinating backups across AWS services. With AWS Backup, you gain a fully managed, policy-based backup solution with snapshot scheduling and snapshot retention management. You can now create, manage, and restore Aurora backups directly from the AWS Backup console for both PostgreSQL-compatible and MySQL-compatible versions of Aurora.
To get started, select an Amazon Aurora cluster from the AWS Backup console and take an on-demand backup or simply assign the cluster to a backup plan.

     A is not a valid option for meeting the requirements. A manual snapshot of the DB cluster is a point-in-time copy of the data in the cluster. While taking manual snapshots can be useful for creating backups of the data, it is not a reliable or efficient way to meet the requirement of storing all the data for 5 years and deleting it after 5 years. It would be difficult to ensure that manual snapshots are taken regularly and retained for the required period of time. It is recommended to use a fully managed backup service like AWS Backup, which can automate and centralize the process of taking and retaining backups.

B. Create a lifecycle policy for the automated backups.
This would ensure that the backups taken using AWS Backup are retained for the desired period of time.

You can use CloudFront to deliver video on demand (VOD) or live streaming video using any HTTP origin

Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses

     Option A (Amazon CloudFront) is a content delivery network (CDN) service that can improve the performance of on-demand streaming by caching and delivering content from edge locations. While it can accelerate on-demand streaming, it may not provide the same level of optimization for real-time streaming as AWS Global Accelerator.

CloudFront solves the problem of streaming over Amazon CDN on global scale. 

"B" AWS Global Accelerator won't be suitable for streaming from web server as it does not provide edge caching like CDN. Global Accelerator only points the user to nearest functioning node which is helpful for real-time streaming but not best for on-demand.

"AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that helps you improve the availability, performance, and security of your public applications. Global Accelerator provides two global static public IPs that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints, such as Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, and elastic IPs."
It is Anycast which connect user to closest resource on your server like ALB etc or ergional services.
CloudFront is CDN and pushes your content to edge locations near the user. This solves all issues of latency and performance

     You can use CloudFront to deliver video on demand (VOD) or live streaming video using any HTTP origin

Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses

     CloudFront offers several options for streaming your media to global viewers—both pre-recorded files and live events.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/IntroductionUseCases.html#IntroductionUseCasesStreaming

For video on demand (VOD) streaming, you can use CloudFront to stream in common formats such as MPEG DASH, Apple HLS, Microsoft Smooth Streaming, and CMAF, to any device.

For broadcasting a live stream, you can cache media fragments at the edge, so that multiple requests for the manifest file that delivers the fragments in the right order can be combined, to reduce the load on your origin server.

     Please stop posting answers from ChatGPT. 
"The event is expected to attract a global online audience." 

 Global Accelerator is a service that accelerates traffic to Google Cloud services from users around the world. If you're looking to stream audio content to a global audience, Global Accelerator may be more suitable due to its ability to route traffic through the nearest edge locations and reduce latency. However, if you're looking to stream audio content from a single source to a local audience, CloudFront may be a better option.

     C) WAF has bot identification and remedial tools, so it's CORRECT.

A) remember the question : "...block requests from unauthorized users?" -- an api key is involved in a authorization process. It's not the more secure process, but it's better than an totoally anonymous process. If you don't know the key, you can't authenticate. So the bots, at least the first days/weeks could not access the service (at the end they'll do, cos' the key will be spread informally). So it's CORRECT.

B) Implement a logic in the Lambda to detect fraudulent ip's is almost impossible, cos' it's a dynamic and changing pattern that you cannot handle easily.

D) creating a rol is not going to imply be more protected from unauth. request, because a rol is a "principal", it's not involved in the authorization process.

       Don't use API keys for authentication or authorization to control access to your APIs. If you have multiple APIs in a usage plan, a user with a valid API key for one API in that usage plan can access all APIs in that usage plan. Instead, to control access to your API, use an IAM role, a Lambda authorizer, or an Amazon Cognito user pool.

     C) Everyone agrees on C

B) Almost impossible cos how do you detect fraudulent IP address from a publicly accessible application
D) It's a publicly accessible application, converting the API to a private one defeats the purpose
E) IAM role for each user trying to access a publicly accessible API is impossible. It like creating an IAM for each user that tries to use google AUTH for their website
A) By implementing API keys and usage plans, you can restrict access to your API to only those users who possess the key, helping to limit fraudulent access.

     I'll throw a curveball over here. "C" is a given as WAF rules can target malicious usage. For example: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/aws-waf-ip-reputation.html

"D" Convert existing public API to a private API. This part is same as A. The additional bit over here is to change the DNS record to a new API endpoint which blocks the requests from unauthorised users also. The unauthorised users will not be redirected from public to private API endpoint. I am assuming that the public API endpoint will be used for authorisation and only authorised users will be redirected to private endpoint. This is more robust as the actual API (private endpoint) never gets hit with requests from unauthorised bots and WAF redirects it back to public URL.

Happy to be corrected and challenged

     A. Create plans using API keys shared only with real users: While using API keys is a standard way to control access to APIs, using API keys alone may not completely prevent attacks from botnets. Malicious request.

B. Incorporate logic in the Lambda function to ignore requests from fraudulent IP addresses: This may be a solution, but filtering that relies more on IP addresses may not be as flexible as using AWS WAF.

D. Convert an existing public API to a private API. Update DNS records to redirect users to the new API endpoint: This approach makes the API private, but requires user redirects and may inconvenience existing users.

     The reasons are:

An API key with a usage plan limits access to only authorized apps and users. This prevents general public access.
WAF rules can identify and block malicious bot traffic through pattern matching and IP reputation lists.
Together, the API key and WAF provide preventative and detective controls against unauthorized requests.
The other options add complexity or are reactive. IAM roles per user is not feasible for a public API.
Ignoring requests in Lambda and changing DNS are response actions after an attack.

it's essential to note that while API keys are commonly associated with private APIs, they can also be used in conjunction with public APIs. In some cases, even public APIs may require API keys to control usage and monitor how the API is being utilized. The API provider might enforce usage limits, track API usage, or monitor for potential misuse, all of which can be managed effectively using API keys.

In summary, API keys are not exclusive to private APIs and can be used for both private and public APIs, depending on the specific requirements and use case of the API provider.

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval cost (Monthly): 0.00 USD

if it was 3GB:
3 GB / month storage without retrieval when file is single 3GB file:
S3 Standard cost (Monthly): 0.07 USD
S3 Standard cost (Upfront): 0.00 USD
S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval cost (Monthly): 0.01 USD

When assumed no retrieval is required because it's DR solution, and it's a single file, Glacier Instant Retrieval wins, and when they mention S3 glacier we must choose one of the sub-category

     The reasons are:

S3 Standard provides high durability and availability for storage
It allows millisecond access to retrieve objects
Objects can be stored for any duration, meeting the 30 day retention need
Storage costs are low, around $0.023 per GB/month
OpenSearch and RDS require running and managing a cluster for DR storage
Glacier has lower cost but retrieval time is too high at 3-5 hours
S3 Standard's simplicity, high speed access, and low cost make it optimal for this small DR dataset that needs to be accessed quickly

     S3 Standard is a highly durable and scalable storage option suitable for backup and disaster recovery purposes. It offers millisecond access to data when needed and provides durability guarantees. It is also cost-effective compared to other storage options like OpenSearch Service, S3 Glacier, and RDS for PostgreSQL, which may have higher costs or longer access times for retrieving the data.

A. OpenSearch Service (Elasticsearch Service): While it offers fast data retrieval, it may incur higher costs compared to storing data directly in S3, especially considering the amount of data being generated.

B. S3 Glacier: While it provides long-term archival storage at a lower cost, it does not meet the requirement of immediate access in milliseconds. Retrieving data from Glacier typically takes several hours.

D. RDS for PostgreSQL: While it can be used for data storage, it may be overkill and more expensive for a backup and disaster recovery solution compared to S3 Standard, which is more suitable and cost-effective for storing and retrieving data.

B. Incorrect
S3 Glacier is a cold storage solution that is designed for long-term data retention and infrequent access.
C. Correct
S3 standard is cost-effective and meets the requirement. S3 Standard allows for data retention for a specific number of days.

     By placing the JSON documents in an S3 bucket, the documents will be stored in a highly durable and scalable object storage service. The use of AWS Lambda allows the company to run their Python code to process the documents as they arrive in the S3 bucket without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This also allows for horizontal scalability, as AWS Lambda will automatically scale the number of instances of the function based on the incoming rate of requests. The results can be stored in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, which is a fully-managed, high-performance database service that is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. This will provide the necessary durability and scalability for the results of the processing.

     Ans D - because none of the other answers guarantee FIFO.  What if a subsequent JSON operation is intended to update an existing database record (which is highly likely) - then the wrong change would be applied

     Guys I have a question.
We dont know how long the processing of JSON documents is going to take. What if that processing takes more than 15 min ? Lambda can run only for 15 correct ? Based on this the answer could be D

 Please correct my understanding.

     "D" has a lot of moving parts and more operational overhead even if each part is a managed service in itself. Also, if something can be done with Lambda, don't use an EC2 instance in any form as it always increases operational overhead (compared to Lambda).

     -  Using Lambda functions triggered by S3 events allows the Python code to automatically scale up and down based on the number of incoming JSON documents. This provides high availability and maximizes scalability.
-  Storing the results in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster provides a managed, scalable, and highly available database.
-  This serverless approach minimizes operational overhead since Lambda and Aurora handle provisioning infrastructure, deploying code, monitoring, patching, etc.

     The answer is B. Place the JSON documents in an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an AWS Lambda function that runs the Python code to process the documents as they arrive in the S3 bucket. Store the results in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.
This solution is highly available because Lambda functions are automatically scaled up or down based on the number of requests they receive. It is also scalable because you can easily add more Lambda functions to process more documents. Finally, it minimizes operational overhead because you do not need to manage any EC2 instances.

     Using Lambda eliminates the need to manage and provision servers, ensuring scalability and minimizing operational overhead. S3 provides durable and highly available storage for the JSON documents. Lambda can be triggered automatically whenever new documents are added to the S3 bucket, allowing for real-time processing. Storing the results in an Aurora DB cluster ensures high availability and scalability for the processed data. This solution leverages serverless architecture, allowing for automatic scaling and high availability without the need for managing infrastructure, making it the most suitable choice.

A. This option requires manual management and scaling of EC2 instances, resulting in higher operational overhead and complexity.

C. This approach still involves manual management and scaling of EC2 instances, increasing operational complexity and overhead.

D. This solution requires managing and scaling an ECS cluster, adding operational overhead and complexity. Utilizing SQS adds complexity to the system, requiring custom handling of message consumption and processing in the Python code.

     The reasons are:

Amazon FSx for Lustre provides a high-performance, scalable file system optimized for compute-intensive workloads like HPC. It has native integration with Amazon S3.
Data can be copied from on-premises to an S3 bucket, acting as persistent long-term storage.
The FSx for Lustre file system can then access the S3 data for high speed processing of datasets and output files.
FSx for Lustre is designed for the Linux environments used in this HPC workload.

     FSx for Lustre is a high-performance file system optimized for compute-intensive workloads. It provides scalable, parallel access to data and is suitable for HPC applications.
By integrating FSx for Lustre with S3, you can easily copy on-premises data to long-term persistent storage in S3, making it available for processing by EC2 instances.
S3 serves as the durable and highly scalable object storage for storing the output files, allowing for analytics and long-term future use.

Option B, FSx for Windows File Server, is not suitable because the workloads run on Linux, and this option is designed for Windows file sharing.

Option C, S3 Glacier integrated with EBS, is not the best choice as it is a low-cost archival storage service and not optimized for high-performance file system requirements.

Option D, using an S3 bucket with a VPC endpoint integrated with an Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume, does not provide the required high-performance file system capabilities for HPC workloads.

     Using ECR provides a fully managed container image registry.
ECS with Fargate launch type allows running containers without managing servers or clusters. Fargate will handle scaling and optimization.

     ECR provides a secure and scalable repository to store and manage container images. ECS with the Fargate launch type allows you to run containers without managing the underlying infrastructure, providing a serverless experience. Target tracking in ECS can automatically scale the number of tasks or services based on a target value such as CPU or memory utilization, ensuring that the application can handle increasing demand without manual intervention.

Option B is not the best choice because using the EC2 launch type requires managing and scaling EC2 instances, which increases operational overhead.

Option C is not the optimal solution as it involves managing the container repository on an EC2 instance and manually launching EC2 instances, which adds complexity and operational overhead.

Option D also requires managing EC2 instances, configuring ASGs, and setting up manual scaling rules based on CloudWatch alarms, which is not as efficient or scalable as using Fargate in combination with ECS.

     Amazon SQS supports dead-letter queues (DLQ), which other queues (source queues) can target for messages that can't be processed (consumed) successfully.

     Ans C - Use SQS and dead letter queue.  
Not ideal because max visibility timeout for SQS is 12h and can't extended by user. 
I did consider B: KInesis which is for real-time processing - altho' the question doesn't say its not real-time.  Anyway, SQS is basic and fits.

     C) This option works. There is a 12h maximum visibility timeout, but:

"If you don't know how long it takes to process a message, create a heartbeat for your consumer process: Specify the initial visibility timeout (for example, 2 minutes) and then—as long as your consumer still works on the message—keep extending the visibility timeout by 2 minutes every minute."

     None of the options fit. 

A) Not operationally efficient 
B) Kinesis is for real-time processing 
D) SNS is not suitable for work queuing. 

C) While this may be the "correct" answer, it also doesn't really fit the problem statement.

Maximum visibility timeout for SQS is 12h, also can't be extended by the consumer. 

"If your consumer needs longer than 12 hours, consider using Step Functions."

       It doesn't seem to be the case though:

" For example, assume that a message spends 1 day in the original queue before it's moved to a dead-letter queue. If the dead-letter queue's retention period is 4 days, the message is deleted from the dead-letter queue after 3 days and the ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage is 3 days."

     Implement an AWS service to handle messages between the two applications = Amazon Simple Queue Service
If the messages fail to process, they must be retained = a dead-letter queue

     SQS provides a fully managed message queuing service that meets all the requirements:

SQS can handle the sending and processing of 1,000 messages per hour
Messages can be retained for up to 14 days to allow the full 2 days for processing
Using a dead-letter queue will retain failed messages without impacting other processing
SQS requires minimal operational overhead compared to running your own message queue server

     Answer is B), the reason is:
- Because messages might up to 2 days to be processed. Visibility timeout of SQS is 12 hours, so after 12 hours another consumer might take a message from the queue which is currently being processed.

     By integrating both the sender and processor applications with an SQS, messages can be reliably sent from the sender to the processor application for processing. SQS provides at-least-once delivery, ensuring that messages are not lost in transit. If a message fails to process, it can be retained in the queue and retried without impacting the processing of other messages. Configuring a DLQ allows for the collection of messages that repeatedly fail to process, providing visibility into failed messages for troubleshooting and analysis.

A is not the optimal choice as it involves managing and configuring an EC2 instance running a Redis, which adds operational overhead and maintenance requirements.

B is not the most operationally efficient solution as it introduces additional complexity by using Amazon Kinesis data streams and integrating with the Kinesis Client Library for message processing.

D, using SNS, is not the best fit for the scenario as it is more suitable for pub/sub messaging and broadcasting notifications rather than the specific requirement of message processing between two applications.

only problem with this is the limit of the visibility timeout is 12H max. as the second application take 2 days to process, there will be a duplicate of processing messages in the queue. this might complicate things.

       Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages that have been in a queue for more than the maximum message retention period. The default message retention period is 4 days. However, you can set the message retention period to a value from 60 seconds to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days) using the SetQueueAttributes action.

     Option C, using Amazon SQS, is a valid solution that meets the requirements of the company. However, it may not be the most operationally efficient solution because SQS is a managed message queue service that requires additional operational overhead to handle the retention of messages that failed to process. Option B, using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, is more operationally efficient for this use case because it can handle the retention of messages that failed to process automatically and provides the ability to process and analyze streaming data in real-time.

       Kinesis stream save data for up to 24 hours, doesn't meet the 2 day requirement.
Kinesis streams don't have fail-safe for failed processing, unlike SQS.

         this is not a correct statement.
A data stream is a logical grouping of shards. There are no bounds on the number of shards within a data stream (request a limit increase if you need more). A data stream will retain data for 24 hours by default, or optionally up to 365 days.

     By configuring CloudFront to forward all incoming requests to AWS WAF, the traffic will be inspected by AWS WAF before reaching the S3 origin, complying with the security policy requirement. This approach ensures that all website traffic is inspected by AWS WAF, providing an additional layer of security before accessing the content stored in the S3 origin.

Option A is not the correct choice as configuring an S3 bucket policy to accept requests from the AWS WAF ARN only would bypass the inspection of traffic by AWS WAF. It does not ensure that all website traffic is inspected.

Option C is not the optimal solution as it focuses on controlling access to S3 using a security group. Although it associates AWS WAF with CloudFront, it does not guarantee that all incoming requests are inspected by AWS WAF.

Option D is not the recommended solution as configuring an OAI in CloudFront and restricting access to the S3 bucket does not ensure that all website traffic is inspected by AWS WAF. The OAI is used for restricting direct access to S3 content, but the traffic should still pass through AWS WAF for inspection.

D: not ideal because configuring an OAI in CloudFront and restricting access to the S3 bucket does not guarantee website traffic is inspected by WAF.

     B is incorrect , it  misrepresents how AWS WAF works with CloudFront. AWS WAF is not an intermediary service that CloudFront forwards requests to. Instead, AWS WAF is directly integrated with CloudFront as a layer to inspect incoming requests. The correct configuration is to associate AWS WAF with the CloudFront distribution, not to forward requests separately.

     The requirements indicate that S3 is used to "store" a static website, not that it must be configured as a static website (which does not make any sense if it's to be used with CF anyway).   Furthermore, the requirements also indicate that all traffic must be inspected by WAF.  If you do not setup OAI/OAC, you can potentially bypass CF and access S3 directly.  So option B does not satisfy the second requirement.

     Using an OAI (Origin Access Identity) restricts access to the S3 bucket, ensuring that only CloudFront can access the content.
Enabling AWS WAF on the CloudFront distribution allows you to inspect website traffic and filter out malicious requests before they reach your S3 origin.

     There are two ways you can serve static websites on AWS S3 origin, either using website endpoints or REST API endpoints. Website endpoints does not support HTTPS. Note that the question does not mention which endpoint is used.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteEndpoints.html#WebsiteRestEndpointDiff

B is incorrect because we do not 'forward' requests to AWS WAF, we attach WAF on the Cloudfront distribution itself. Could be bad wording of the question.

D is totally valid because it doesn't mention using website endpoints. D also uses OAI to restrict direct access to objects in AWS S3. Although OAI is still viable in this point of time, it is still a legacy method and it is more recommended to use OAC instead.

     Option B ensures that all incoming requests to the static website served through Amazon CloudFront are first forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection before the content is requested from the S3 origin. This ensures that all website traffic is inspected by AWS WAF as required by the company's security policy.

     The most effective and efficient solution would be Option D (Use Amazon CloudFront with the S3 bucket as its origin.) 

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of static and dynamic web content, such as HTML pages, images, and videos. By using CloudFront, the HTML pages will be served to users from the edge location that is closest to them, resulting in faster delivery and a better user experience. CloudFront can also handle the high traffic and large number of requests expected for the global event, ensuring that the HTML pages are available and accessible to users around the world.

     CloudFront is the best solution for this use case because:

CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations around the world. This brings content closer to users for fast performance.
For high traffic global events with millions of viewers, a CDN is necessary for effective distribution.
Using the S3 bucket as the origin, CloudFront can fetch the files once and cache them globally.

     CloudFront is well-suited for efficiently serving static HTML pages to users around the world. By using itwith the S3 as its origin, the static HTML pages can be cached and distributed globally to edge locations, reducing latency and improving performance for users accessing the pages from different regions. This solution ensures efficient and effective delivery of the daily reports to millions of users worldwide, providing a scalable and high-performance solution for the global event.

A would allow temporary access to the files, but it does not address the scalability and performance requirements of serving millions of views globally.

B is not necessary for this scenario as the goal is to distribute the static HTML pages efficiently to users worldwide, not replicate the files across multiple Regions.

C is primarily used for routing DNS traffic based on the geographic location of users, but it does not provide the caching and content delivery capabilities required for this use case.

CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It functions as a reverse proxy service that caches web content across AWS's global data centers, improving loading speeds and reducing the strain on origin servers. CloudFront can be used to efficiently deliver large amounts of static or dynamic content anywhere in the world.

           I am leaning towards C because the idea of having a queue is to decouple the processing. If an instance goes down(spot) while processing will it not show up back after the visibility timeout? So using spot meets the cost-effective objective.

           cost-effectively means, Cheapest solution (cost) that achieve all the requirements (effectively). Its not cost-effectively if is just cheapest solution that fail to address all the requirements, in this case. (This application should continually process messages without any downtime) no matter the volume, since it is unpredictable. B for example, address the requirement but not the cheapest solution that achieve it. D   is the cheaper choice that address the requirement (without any downtime). and C is cheaper than D but do not garantee that you wont have downtime since it is SPOT instances.

             When traffic spikes and there happens to an increase in the spot price, if the price exceeds the threshold set then there would be downtime as no additional compute can be acquired. Hence even if spot instances are more cost effective, I would interpret the cost effective requirement to be the ability to reliably acquire new instances and dispose of when not needed, hence on demand instances

     Reserved Instances (RIs) provide a cost-effective way to cover the baseline capacity, ensuring a predictable number of instances are always available.
Spot Instances can handle additional capacity during traffic spikes, providing scalability without committing to a specific number of instances.
This combination (C) offers the most cost-effective solution, as RIs cover the baseline and Spot Instances handle variable demand.

Why not D? On demand is expensive than Spot instances.

     Using Reserved Instances (RIs) for baseline capacity ensures a lower cost for the instances that are constantly required to maintain the application's baseline workload. RIs offer significant cost savings compared to On-Demand instances, making them a cost-effective choice for steady-state workloads.

Spot Instances can then be utilized to handle additional capacity during periods of higher message volume. Spot Instances provide spare EC2 capacity at significantly reduced prices compared to On-Demand instances, allowing for cost savings during peak workloads. Since the message volume is unpredictable and often intermittent, Spot Instances can efficiently handle the fluctuating demand without incurring high costs.

     Missing some information to make a proper decision. What does "without downtime" mean? We are already outside of Realtime processing, and messages can remain in the queue until picked up. Purely using Spot instances _might_ do just fine, but there could be times when no spare capacity is available. How much delay is acceptable? I'd go with reserved+spot, but reserved+on demand may be required for priority on bursty load. 

B is the one option i would rule out completely. The workload is unpredictable, we can't reserve infinity instances for all eternity.

     D. Service control policies (SCPs) are one type of policy that you can use to manage your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization, allowing you to ensure your accounts stay within your organization's access control guidelines. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html.

     By creating an SCP in the root organizational unit, the security team can define and enforce fine-grained permissions that limit access to specific services or actions across all member accounts. The SCP acts as a guardrail, denying access to specified services or actions, ensuring that the permissions are consistent and applied uniformly across the organization. SCPs are scalable and provide a single point of control for managing permissions, allowing the security team to centrally manage access restrictions without needing to modify individual account settings.

Option A and option B are not suitable for controlling access across multiple accounts in AWS Organizations. ACLs and security groups are typically used for managing network traffic and access within a single account or a specific resource.

Option C is not the recommended approach. Cross-account roles are used for granting access, and denying access through cross-account roles can be complex and less manageable compared to using SCPs.

Service control policies (SCPs) are policies that you can use to set fine-grained permissions for your AWS accounts within your organization.

     By enabling Shield Advanced, the web application benefits from automatic protection against common and sophisticated DDoS attacks. It utilizes advanced detection and mitigation techniques, including ML algorithms and traffic analysis, to provide effective DDoS protection.
It also includes features like real-time monitoring, attack notifications, and detailed attack reports.

A is not related to DDoS protection. Amazon Inspector is a security assessment service that helps identify vulnerabilities and security issues in applications and EC2.

B is also not the appropriate solution. Macie is a service that uses machine learning to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in AWS. It focuses on data security and protection, not specifically on DDoS prevention.

D is not the most effective solution. GuardDuty is a threat detection service that analyzes events and network traffic to identify potential security threats and anomalies. While it can provide insights into potential DDoS attacks, it does not actively prevent or mitigate them.

     To reduce the risk of DDoS attacks against the application, the solutions architect should enable AWS Shield Advanced (Option C).

AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that helps protect web applications running on AWS from DDoS attacks. AWS Shield Advanced is an additional layer of protection that provides enhanced DDoS protection capabilities, including proactive monitoring and automatic inline mitigations, to help protect against even the largest and most sophisticated DDoS attacks. By enabling AWS Shield Advanced, the solutions architect can help protect the application from DDoS attacks and reduce the risk of disruption to the application.

     By configuring AWS WAF on the ALB in a VPC, you can apply access control rules based on the geographic location of the incoming requests. AWS WAF allows you to create rules that include conditions based on the IP addresses' country of origin. You can specify the desired country and deny access to requests originating from any other country by leveraging AWS WAF's Geo Match feature.

Option A and option B focus on network-level access control and do not provide country-specific filtering capabilities.

Option D is not the ideal solution for restricting access based on country. Network ACLs primarily control traffic at the subnet level based on IP addresses and port numbers, but they do not have built-in capabilities for country-based filtering.

     To meet the requirement of allowing the web application to be accessed from one specific country only, the company should configure AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) on the Application Load Balancer in a VPC (Option C).

AWS WAF is a web application firewall service that helps protect web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF allows you to create rules that block or allow traffic based on the values of specific request parameters, such as IP address, HTTP header, or query string value. By configuring AWS WAF on the Application Load Balancer and creating rules that allow traffic from a specific country, the company can ensure that the web application is only accessible from that country.

     Option D is similar to option B in that it uses Amazon API Gateway to handle the API requests, but it also includes an EC2 instance to perform the tax computations. However, using an EC2 instance in this way is less scalable and less elastic than using AWS Lambda to perform the computations. An EC2 instance is a fixed resource and requires manual scaling and management, while Lambda is an event-driven, serverless compute service that automatically scales with the number of requests, making it more suitable for handling variable workloads and reducing response times during high traffic periods. Additionally, Lambda is more cost-efficient than EC2 instances, as you only pay for the compute time consumed by your functions, making it a more cost-effective solution.

     Option B leverages AWS Lambda, which is a serverless compute service that automatically scales in response to incoming requests. When a request is made to the API hosted on Amazon API Gateway, API Gateway triggers the associated AWS Lambda function, passing the item names as input parameters. The Lambda function then performs the tax computations based on the provided item names. AWS Lambda automatically manages the compute capacity, ensuring that there is no need to provision or manage servers. This serverless architecture offers scalability and elasticity, as Lambda functions can scale out to handle a larger number of inquiries during the holiday season and scale in during periods of lower demand. Additionally, AWS Lambda is a fully managed service, reducing operational overhead for the company.

     Though EC2 can scale (even if less flexible than Lambda), neither A, C nor D involve scaling. All these answers are about a single EC2 instance or a pair of EC2 instances. The only answer that includes scaling and elasticity is B.

     B) Design a REST API using Amazon API Gateway that accepts the item names. API Gateway passes item names to AWS Lambda for tax computations.

This option provides the most scalable and elastic solution:

API Gateway handles creating the REST API frontend to receive requests
Lambda functions scale automatically to handle spikes in traffic during peak seasons
No servers to manage for the computations, providing high scalability

     Option A (hosting an API on an Amazon EC2 instance) would require manual management and scaling of the EC2 instances, making it less scalable and elastic compared to a serverless solution.

Option C (creating an Application Load Balancer with EC2 instances for tax computations) also involves manual management of the instances and does not offer the same level of scalability and elasticity as a serverless solution.

Option D (designing a REST API using API Gateway and connecting it with an API hosted on an EC2 instance) adds unnecessary complexity and management overhead. It is more efficient to directly integrate API Gateway with AWS Lambda for tax computations.

Therefore, designing a REST API using Amazon API Gateway and integrating it with AWS Lambda (option B) is the recommended approach to achieve a scalable and elastic solution for the company's API during the holiday season.

Field-level encryption allows you to enable your users to securely upload sensitive information to your web servers. The sensitive information provided by your users is encrypted at the edge, close to the user, and remains encrypted throughout your entire application stack. This encryption ensures that only applications that need the data—and have the credentials to decrypt it—are able to do so.

     Options A and B (signed URL and signed cookie) are used for controlling access to specific resources and are typically used for restricting access based on URLs or cookies. They do not provide field-level encryption for sensitive data within HTTP requests.

Option D (configuring CloudFront with the Origin Protocol Policy set to HTTPS Only for the Viewer Protocol Policy) is related to enforcing HTTPS communication between CloudFront and the viewer (end-user). While important for security, it doesn't address the specific requirement of protecting sensitive data within the application stack.

     B) Deploy an Amazon CloudFront web distribution in front of the S3 bucket.

CloudFront is the most cost-effective solution for this use case because:

CloudFront can cache static assets like videos and images at edge locations closer to users. This improves performance.
Serving files from the CloudFront cache reduces load on the S3 origin.
CloudFront pricing is very low for data transfer and requests.

     Option A is not the most cost-effective solution for this scenario. While Global Accelerator can improve global application performance, it is primarily used for accelerating TCP and UDP traffic, such as gaming and real-time applications, rather than serving static media files.

Options C and D are used for caching frequently accessed data in-memory to improve application performance. However, they are not specifically designed for caching and serving media files like CloudFront, and therefore, may not provide the same cost-effectiveness and scalability for this use case.

Hence, deploying an CloudFront web distribution in front of the S3 is the most cost-effective solution for delivering media files to millions of users worldwide while reducing the load on the origin.

     ElastiCache, enhances the performance of web applications by quickly retrieving information from fully-managed in-memory data stores. It utilizes Memcached and Redis, and manages to considerably reduce the time your applications would, otherwise, take to read data from disk-based databases. 

Amazon CloudFront supports dynamic content from HTTP and WebSocket protocols, which are based on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) protocol. Common use cases include dynamic API calls, web pages and web applications, as well as an application's static files such as audio and images. It also supports on-demand media streaming over HTTP.

AWS Global Accelerator supports both User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and TCP-based protocols. It is commonly used for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming, IoT and voice over IP. It is also good for HTTP use cases that need static IP addresses or fast regional failover

     The company wants to provide the files to the users while reducing the load on the origin.
Cloudfront speeds-up content delivery but I'm not sure it reduces the load on the origin.
Some form of caching would cache content and deliver to users without going to the origin for each request.

       ElastiCache for Redis (C) can be used by an application to store key-value pairs. It does not cache videos or images and it is not an automatic process (the application can put and retrieve values).

     To provide media files to users while reducing the load on the origin and meeting the requirements cost-effectively, the gaming company should deploy an Amazon CloudFront web distribution in front of the S3 bucket (Option B).

CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of static and dynamic web content, such as images and videos, to users. By using CloudFront, the media files will be served to users from the edge location that is closest to them, resulting in faster delivery and a better user experience. CloudFront can also handle the high traffic and large number of requests expected from the millions of users, ensuring that the media files are available and accessible to users around the world.

     Option A (creating an Auto Scaling group across two Regions) introduces additional complexity and potential replication challenges, which may not be necessary for achieving high availability within a single Region.

Option C (creating an Auto Scaling template for another Region) suggests multi-region redundancy, which may not be the most straightforward solution for achieving high availability without modifying the application.

Option D (changing the ALB to a round-robin configuration) does not provide the desired high availability. Round-robin configuration alone does not ensure fault tolerance and does not leverage multiple Availability Zones for resilience.

Hence, modifying the Auto Scaling group to use three instances across each of two Availability Zones is the appropriate choice to provide high availability for the multi-tier application.

     Option B. Modify the Auto Scaling group to use three instances across each of the two Availability Zones.

This option would provide high availability by distributing the front-end web servers across multiple Availability Zones. If there is an issue with one Availability Zone, the other Availability Zone would still be available to serve traffic. This would ensure that the application remains available and highly available even if there is a failure in one of the Availability Zones.

option B This architecture provides high availability by having multiple Availability Zones hosting the same application. This allows for redundancy in case one Availability Zone experiences downtime, as traffic can be served by the other Availability Zone. This solution also increases scalability and performance by allowing traffic to be spread across two Availability Zones.

     Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large number of open connections to the database server and may open and close database connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability.

     Option A (configuring provisioned concurrency and creating a global database) does not directly address the high connection utilization issue on the database, and creating a global database may introduce additional complexity without immediate benefit to solving the timeout errors.

Option C (creating a read replica in a different AWS Region) introduces additional data replication and management complexity, which may not be necessary to address the timeout errors.

Option D (migrating to Amazon DynamoDB) involves a significant change in the data storage technology and requires modifying the application to use DynamoDB instead of Aurora PostgreSQL. This may not be the most suitable solution when the goal is to make minimal changes to the application.

Therefore, using Amazon RDS Proxy and modifying the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint is the recommended solution to prevent timeout errors and reduce the impact on the database during peak loads.

Using Amazon RDS Proxy can help reduce the number of connections to the database and improve the performance of the application. RDS Proxy establishes a connection pool to the database and routes connections to the available connections in the pool. This can help reduce the number of open connections to the database and improve the performance of the application. The Lambda function can be modified to use the RDS Proxy endpoint instead of the database endpoint to take advantage of this improvement.

Using Amazon RDS Proxy will allow the application to handle more connections and higher loads without timeouts, while making the least possible changes to the application. The RDS Proxy will enable connection pooling, allowing multiple connections from the Lambda function to be served from a single proxy connection. This will reduce the number of open connections on the database, which is causing high CPU and memory utilization

     Option B (using a NAT gateway in a public subnet) and option C (using a NAT instance in a private subnet) are not the most secure options because they involve routing traffic through a network address translation (NAT) device, which requires an internet gateway and traverses the public internet.

Option D (using the internet gateway attached to the VPC) would require routing traffic through the internet gateway, which would result in the traffic leaving the AWS network.

Therefore, the recommended and most secure approach is to use a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB to ensure private and secure access to the DynamoDB table from your EC2 instances in private subnets, without the need to traverse the internet or leave the AWS network.

     VPC endpoints for DynamoDB can alleviate these challenges. A VPC endpoint for DynamoDB enables Amazon EC2 instances in your VPC to use their private IP addresses to access DynamoDB with no exposure to the public internet. Your EC2 instances do not require public IP addresses, and you don't need an internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway in your VPC. You use endpoint policies to control access to DynamoDB. Traffic between your VPC and the AWS service does not leave the Amazon network.

The most secure way to access an Amazon DynamoDB table from Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets while ensuring that the traffic does not leave the AWS network is to use Amazon VPC Endpoints for DynamoDB.

Amazon VPC Endpoints enable private communication between Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC and Amazon services such as DynamoDB, without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection. When you create a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB, traffic from the EC2 instances to the DynamoDB table remains within the AWS network and does not traverse the public internet.

     The most secure way to access the DynamoDB table while ensuring that the traffic does not leave the AWS network is Option A (Use a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB.)

A VPC endpoint for DynamoDB allows you to privately connect your VPC to the DynamoDB service without requiring an Internet Gateway, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. This ensures that the traffic between the application and the DynamoDB table stays within the AWS network and is not exposed to the public Internet.

       Option B, using a NAT gateway in a public subnet, would allow the traffic to leave the AWS network and traverse the public Internet, which is less secure. 

Option C, using a NAT instance in a private subnet, would also allow the traffic to leave the AWS network but would require you to manage the NAT instance yourself. 

Option D, using the internet gateway attached to the VPC, would also expose the traffic to the public Internet.

     DAX stands for DynamoDB Accelerator, and it's like a turbo boost for your DynamoDB tables. It's a fully managed, in-memory cache that speeds up the read and write performance of your DynamoDB tables, so you can get your data faster than ever before.

     A. Using Amazon ElastiCache for Redis would require modifying the application code and is not specifically designed to enhance DynamoDB performance.

C. Replicating data with DynamoDB global tables would require additional configuration and operational overhead.

D. Using Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Discovery enabled would also require application code modifications and is not specifically designed for improving DynamoDB performance.

In contrast, option B, using Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), is the recommended solution as it is purpose-built for enhancing DynamoDB performance without the need for application reconfiguration. DAX provides a managed caching layer that significantly reduces read latency and offloads traffic from DynamoDB tables.

     To improve the performance efficiency of DynamoDB without reconfiguring the application, a solutions architect should recommend using Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) which is Option B as the correct answer.

DAX is a fully managed, in-memory cache that can be used to improve the performance of read-intensive workloads on DynamoDB. DAX stores frequently accessed data in memory, allowing the application to retrieve data from the cache rather than making a request to DynamoDB. This can significantly reduce the number of read requests made to DynamoDB, improving the performance and reducing the latency of the application.

     Using AWS Backup to copy EC2 and RDS backups to the separate Region is the solution that meets the requirements with the least operational overhead. AWS Backup simplifies the backup process and automates the copying of backups to another Region, reducing the manual effort and operational complexity involved in managing separate backup processes for EC2 instances and RDS databases.

Option B is incorrect because Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) is not designed for directly copying RDS backups to a separate region.

Option C is incorrect because creating Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and read replicas adds complexity and operational overhead compared to a dedicated backup solution.

Option D is incorrect because using Amazon EBS snapshots, RDS snapshots, and S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) involves multiple manual steps and additional configuration, increasing complexity.

     The easiest way to backup an EC2 instance and RDS Database would be to use AWS Backup. With AWS Backup you can:

Create a backup plan and select both the EC2 volume and RDS database for backup.

Choose a backup schedule that meets your requirements, such as daily or weekly backups.

AWS Backup will automatically take snapshots of the EC2 volume and backups of the RDS database as per the configured schedule.

The backups will be stored in S3 for long term retention based on your backup plan configuration.

       You can easily restore the EC2 volume or RDS database from these backups in case of data loss or corruption.

AWS manages the entire backup process so there is no operational overhead for you.

Some other options include using cron jobs to trigger snapshots and backups. But AWS Backup provides a fully managed service to centrally backup both EC2 and RDS with minimal effort. 

The above is the output from Amazon Q.

     Option B, using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to copy EC2 backups and RDS backups to the separate Region, would require more operational overhead because DLM is primarily designed for managing the lifecycle of Amazon EBS snapshots, and would require additional configuration to manage RDS backups.

Option C, creating AMIs of the EC2 instances and read replicas of the RDS DB instance in the separate Region, would require more manual effort to manage the backup and disaster recovery process, as it requires manual creation and management of AMIs and read replicas.

     Cross-Region backup
Using AWS Backup, you can copy backups to multiple different AWS Regions on demand or automatically as part of a scheduled backup plan. Cross-Region backup is particularly valuable if you have business continuity or compliance requirements to store backups a minimum distance away from your production data.

Amazon DLM is a fully managed service that helps automate the creation and retention of Amazon EBS snapshots and RDS DB snapshots. It can be used to create and manage backup policies that specify when and how often snapshots should be created, as well as how long they should be retained. With Amazon DLM, you can easily and automatically create and manage backups of your EC2 instances and RDS DB instances in a separate Region, with minimal operational overhead.

     CORRECT Option A

To securely store a database user name and password in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and allow an application running on an EC2 instance to access it, the solutions architect should create an IAM role that has read access to the Parameter Store parameter and allow Decrypt access to an AWS KMS key that is used to encrypt the parameter. The solutions architect should then assign this IAM role to the EC2 instance.

This approach allows the EC2 instance to access the parameter in the Parameter Store and decrypt it using the specified KMS key while enforcing the necessary security controls to ensure that the parameter is only accessible to authorized parties.

       Option B, would not be sufficient, as IAM policies cannot be directly attached to EC2 instances.

Option C, would not be a valid solution, as the Parameter Store parameter and the EC2 instance are not entities that can be related through an IAM trust relationship.

Option D, would not be a valid solution, as the trust policy would not allow the EC2 instance to access the parameter in the Parameter Store or decrypt it using the specified KMS key.

You can't attach a policy to EC2. You have to attach a role.

     By creating an IAM role with read access to the Parameter Store parameter and Decrypt access to the associated AWS KMS key, the EC2 will have the necessary permissions to securely retrieve and decrypt the database user name and password from the Parameter Store. This approach ensures that the sensitive information is protected and can be accessed only by authorized entities.

Answers B, C, and D are not correct because they do not provide a secure way to store and retrieve the database user name and password from the Parameter Store. IAM policies, trust relationships, and associations with the DB instance are not the appropriate mechanisms for securely managing sensitive credentials in this scenario. Answer A is the correct choice as it involves creating an IAM role with the necessary permissions and assigning it to the EC2 instance to access the Parameter Store securely.

     By creating an IAM role and assigning it to the EC2 instance, the application running on the EC2 instance can access the Parameter Store parameter securely without the need for hard-coding the database user name and password in the application code.

The IAM role should have read access to the Parameter Store parameter and Decrypt access to an AWS KMS key that is used to encrypt the parameter to ensure that the parameter is protected at rest.

     There should be the Decrypt access to KMS.
"If you choose the SecureString parameter type when you create your parameter, Systems Manager uses AWS KMS to encrypt the parameter value."

     Answer A
Create an IAM role that has read access to the Parameter Store parameter. Allow Decrypt access to an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that is used to encrypt the parameter. Assign this IAM role to the EC2 instance. This solution will allow the application to securely access the database user name and password stored in the parameter store.

       Access to Parameter Store is enabled by IAM policies and supports resource level permissions for access. An IAM policy that grants permissions to specific parameters or a namespace can be used to limit access to these parameters. CloudTrail logs, if enabled for the service, record any attempt to access a parameter.

     B. AWS Shield Advanced provides advanced DDoS protection for the NLB, making it the appropriate choice for protecting against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks at the network layer.

C. AWS WAF is designed to provide protection at the application layer, making it suitable for securing the API Gateway against web exploits like SQL injection.

A. AWS WAF is not compatible with NLB as it operates at the application layer, whereas NLB operates at the transport layer.

D. While GuardDuty helps detect threats, it does not directly protect against web exploits or DDoS attacks. Shield Standard focuses on edge resources, not specifically NLBs.

E. Shield Standard provides basic DDoS protection for edge resources, but it does not directly protect the NLB or address web exploits at the application layer.

     NLB is a Lyer 3/4 component while WAF is a Layer 7 protection component.

That is why WAF is only available for Application Load Balancer in the ELB portfolio. NLB does not terminate the TLS session therefore WAF is not capable of acting on the content. I would consider using AWS Shield at Layer 3/4.

INCORRECT, cos' WAF not integrate with network LB
	• B. Use AWS Shield Advanced with the NLB.

YES. AWS Shield Advanced provides additional protections against more sophisticated and larger attacks for your applications running in AWS.
The doubt is : why apply the protection in the NLB when the facing of the app. is the API Gateway?, because Shield shoud be in front of the communications, not behind.
Nevertheless, this is the best option. 

	• C. Use AWS WAF to protect Amazon API Gateway. 
YES, https://aws.amazon.com/es/waf/faqs/
	• D. Use Amazon GuardDuty with AWS Shield Standard 
INCORRECT, GuardDuty not prevent attacks.
	•E. Use AWS Shield Standard with Amazon API Gateway. 
INCORRECT. It could be, in principle, a good option, cos' it's in front of the gateway, but the questions said explicity:
"wants to detect and mitigate large, sophisticated DDoS attacks",
and Standard not provide this feature.

     Regional resources

You can protect regional resources in all Regions where AWS WAF is available. You can see the list at AWS WAF endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

You can use AWS WAF to protect the following regional resource types:

Amazon API Gateway REST API

Application Load Balancer

AWS AppSync GraphQL API

Amazon Cognito user pool

You can only associate a web ACL to an Application Load Balancer that's within AWS Regions. For example, you cannot associate a web ACL to an Application Load Balancer that's on AWS Outposts.

A. Use AWS WAF to protect the NLB.
C. Use AWS WAF to protect Amazon API Gateway.

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks. By using AWS WAF to protect the NLB and Amazon API Gateway, the company can provide an additional layer of protection for its cloud communications platform against these types of web exploits.

Your API gateway is on the BACK further behind the NLB. SQL Protect that with the WAF

       About AWS Shield Advanced and Amazon GuardDuty

AWS Shield Advanced is a managed DDoS protection service that provides additional protection for Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS DB instances, Amazon Elastic Load Balancers, and Amazon CloudFront distributions. It can help detect and mitigate large, sophisticated DDoS attacks, "but it does not provide protection against web exploits like SQL injection."

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that uses machine learning and other techniques to identify potentially malicious activity in your AWS accounts. It can be used in conjunction with AWS Shield Standard, which provides basic DDoS protection for Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS DB instances, and Amazon Elastic Load Balancers. However, neither Amazon GuardDuty nor AWS Shield Standard provides protection against web exploits like SQL injection.

Overall, the combination of using AWS WAF to protect the NLB and Amazon API Gateway provides the most protection against web exploits and large, sophisticated DDoS attacks.

     Option B, using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), would not be suitable for this use case, as SNS is a pub/sub messaging service that is designed for one-to-many communication, rather than point-to-point communication between specific microservices.

Option C, using an AWS Lambda function to pass messages, would not be suitable for this use case, as it would require the data producers and data consumers to have a direct connection and invoke the Lambda function, rather than being decoupled through a message queue.

Option D, using an Amazon DynamoDB table with DynamoDB Streams, would not be suitable for this use case, as it would require the data consumers to continuously poll the DynamoDB Streams API to detect new table entries, rather than being notified of new data through a message queue.

       Hence, Option A is the correct answer.

Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Add code to the data producers, and send data to the queue. Add code to the data consumers to process data from the queue.

     A. Creating an Amazon SQS queue allows for asynchronous communication between microservices, decoupling the data producers and consumers. It provides scalability, flexibility, and ensures that data processing can happen independently and at a desired pace.

B. Amazon SNS is more suitable for pub/sub messaging, where multiple subscribers receive the same message. It may not be the best fit for sequential data processing.

C. Using AWS Lambda functions for communication introduces unnecessary complexity and may not be the optimal solution for sequential data processing.

D. Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Streams is primarily designed for real-time data streaming and change capture scenarios. It may not be the most efficient choice for sequential data processing in a microservices architecture.

     A) Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Add code to the data producers, and send data to the queue. Add code to the data consumers to process data from the queue.

For asynchronous communication between decoupled microservices, an SQS queue is the most appropriate service to use.

SQS provides a scalable, highly available queue to buffer messages between producers and consumers.
The order of processing does not matter, so a queue model fits well.
The consumers can scale independently to process messages from the queue.

Though C or D is possible it requires additional components and integration and so they are not efficient. Assuming that rate of incoming requests is within limits that SQS can handle A is best option.

     answer is B. 
An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic can be used for communication between the microservices in this scenario. The data producers can be configured to publish notifications to the topic, and the data consumers can be configured to subscribe to the topic and receive notifications as they are published. This allows for asynchronous communication between the microservices, Question here focus on communication between microservices

     "Minimizes Data Loss" Therefore answer is B.

Amazon RDS read replicas use asynchronous replication, not synchronous. Therefore, this option does not meet the requirement for minimizing data loss as asynchronous replication can result in data lag.

     Option A is incorrect because Amazon RDS does not support synchronous replication to three nodes in three Availability Zones.
Option C is incorrect because while you can create a read replica in a separate AWS Region1, the replication from the primary DB instance to the read replica is asynchronous, not synchronous.

     B. Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled to synchronously replicate the data.

Enabling Multi-AZ functionality in Amazon RDS ensures synchronous replication of data to a standby replica in a different Availability Zone. This provides high availability and minimizes data loss in the event of a database outage.

A. Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance with synchronous replication to three nodes in three Availability Zones would provide even higher availability but is not necessary for the stated requirements.

C. Creating a read replica in a separate AWS Region would provide disaster recovery capabilities but does not ensure synchronous replication or meet the requirement of storing every transaction on at least two nodes.

D. Using an EC2 instance with a MySQL engine and triggering an AWS Lambda function for replication introduces unnecessary complexity and is not the most suitable solution for ensuring reliable and synchronous replication.

     Option A is the correct answer in this scenario because it meets the requirements specified in the question. It creates an Amazon RDS DB instance with synchronous replication to three nodes in three Availability Zones, which will provide high availability and durability for the database, ensuring that the data is stored on multiple nodes and automatically replicated across Availability Zones.

Option B is not a correct answer because it creates an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled, which only provides failover capabilities. It does not enable synchronous replication to multiple nodes, which is required in this scenario.

       I would go with Option B since it meets the company's requirements and is the most suitable solution.

By creating an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled, the solutions architect will ensure that data is automatically synchronously replicated across multiple AZs within the same Region. This provides high availability and data durability, minimizing the risk of data loss and ensuring that every transaction is stored on at least two nodes.

         Could you point us to a source where it says that Aurora Auto Scaling can scale write replicas?   The AWS documentation specifically mentions that it supports only read replicas (e.g. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Integrating.AutoScaling.html):

To meet your connectivity and workload requirements, Aurora Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts the number of Aurora Replicas (reader DB instances) provisioned for an Aurora DB cluster. Aurora Auto Scaling is available for both Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL.

     C,D are out due to EC2 scaling which is not ideal for static content scaling.
A and B are logical choices. B uses Aurora which is more for relational database and comes with the baggage and limitations of RDBMS scaling. DynamDB (no SQL) is easier to scale for both read and write. A is simply better than be for an ordering website so that is the better option. Note that B would have been good if A wasn't a choice.

     Key phrase in the Question is must scale read and write capacity. Aurora is only for Read.
Amazon DynamoDB has two read/write capacity modes for processing reads and writes on your tables:
On-demand
Provisioned (default, free-tier eligible)

     B. This solution leverages serverless technologies like API Gateway and Lambda for hosting dynamic content, reducing server maintenance and patching. Aurora with Aurora Auto Scaling provides a highly available and scalable database solution. Hosting static content in S3 and configuring CloudFront for content delivery ensures high availability and efficient scaling.

A. Using DynamoDB with on-demand capacity may provide scalability, but it does not offer the same level of flexibility and performance as Aurora. Additionally, it does not address the hosting of dynamic content using serverless technologies.

C. Hosting all the website content on EC2 instances requires server maintenance and patching. While using ASG and an ALB helps with availability and scalability, it does not minimize server maintenance as requested.

D. Hosting all the website content on EC2 instances introduces server maintenance and patching. Using Aurora with Aurora Auto Scaling is a good choice for the database, but it does not address the need to minimize server maintenance and patching for the overall infrastructure.

     B isn't correct because of cooldown
You can tune the responsiveness of a target-tracking scaling policy by adding cooldown periods that affect scaling your Aurora DB cluster in and out. A cooldown period blocks subsequent scale-in or scale-out requests until the period expires. These blocks slow the deletions of Aurora Replicas in your Aurora DB cluster for scale-in requests, and the creation of Aurora Replicas for scale-out requests.

       For anyone who is confused about Option B, there's a serverless Aurora service called "Aurora Serverless v2". This will bring us an equivalent solution to option A. But the Option B in the question only states the Aurora, therefore by default we need to manage the servers underneath.

     To configure a VPC for an existing function:

1. Open the Functions page of the Lambda console.
2. Choose a function.
3. Choose Configuration and then choose VPC.
4. Under VPC, choose Edit.
5. Choose a VPC, subnets, and security groups. &lt;-- **That's why I believe the answer is A**.

Note:
If your function needs internet access, use network address translation (NAT). Connecting a function to a public subnet doesn't give it internet access or a public IP address.

     Answer A: During Lambda function creation select "Advanced Settings" select "Enable VPC", this will allow you to select VPC, Subnets and SecurityGroup for your Lambda function. This is the way Lambda can get controlled access to resouces in your VPC.

Default Lambda Settings:
When you create a Lambda function without specifying a VPC, the Lambda function does not get associated with any particular VPC. By default, Lambda functions are not deployed within a VPC and do not have access to resources within a VPC, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, or Elasticache clusters, unless you explicitly configure the Lambda function to connect to a VPC.

     Update the route tables in the VPC to allow the Lambda function to access the on-premises data center through Direct Connect.

By updating the route tables in the VPC to allow the Lambda function to access the on-premises data center through Direct Connect, is the most appropriate solution. By updating the route tables, you can specify the route for traffic from the Lambda function to the IP address range of the on-premises data center via the Direct Connect connection. This ensures that the Lambda function can securely communicate with the database in the private subnet of the data center.

     Every time I read this question the badly phrased options make no sense at all. I now want to vote for A but it makes no sense.
Question says: All non-VPC traffic routes to the virtual private gateway
So Lambda is technically a non VPC traffic too. This means it already goes through the VPGW but we don't know what it connects. Assuming it connect the data-centre to AWS then A makes sense. BUT all this is based on different interpretation now for me.

     The wording is strange because technically, the Lambda function does not "run in the VPC", rather it is connected to the VPC, but otherwise A is what relevant documentation says - connect the Lambda function to the VPN and allow traffic in the security group. 

Not B, we have Direct Connect, no need for VPN.

Not C, route is already in place. And route alone does not help - the "route tables in the VPC" are completely irrelevant as long as we don't connect the Lambda function to the VPC.

Not D, an "Elastic IP address" is always connected to an "elastic network interface", such is created automatically with A.

     A says "configure the Lambda function to RUN IN the VPC", but "a Lambda function ALWAYS runs inside a VPC owned by the Lambda service" (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-networking.html). "You can configure a Lambda function to CONNECT TO private subnets in a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account", but "connect to" is not the same as "run in" (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html). Otherwise A would make sense (you CAN assign a security group to the Elastic Network Interface that Lambda uses to connect to your VPC).

       B We already have Direct Connect, so why set up VPN

C doesn't make sense because "all non-VPC traffic [already] routes to the virtual private gateway" (which is obviously connected to the Direct Connect gateway), so why should you "update the route tables"?

D sounds plausible; however, an Elastic IP address is associated with an Elastic Network Interface (though that is automatically provided by AWS). So the "without an elastic network interface" makes D wrong.

My best guess is that there's a typo or misunderstanding in the answers. It's either A but it should read "connect to the VPC" instead of "run in the VPC", or it's D but it should read "without CREATING an elastic network interface" or "WITH an elastic network interface".

Select the Lambda function that you want to configure.
Click the Configuration tab.
In the Network section, select the VPC that you want the function to run in.
In the Security groups section, select the security group that you want to allow the function to access the database subnet.

     Correct answer is A
Lambda is available in the Region by default.. if you want to connect it to your private subnet or to on prem data center you must configure your Lambda with vpc..

C is wrong because there is no help adding routes to VPC without configuring your lambda to vpc.

     Option A: Configure the Lambda function to run in the VPC with the appropriate security group. This allows the Lambda function to access the database in the private subnet of the company's data center. By running the Lambda function in the VPC, it can communicate with resources in the private subnet securely.

Option B is incorrect because setting up a VPN connection and routing the traffic from the Lambda function through the VPN would add unnecessary complexity and overhead.

Option C is incorrect because updating the route tables in the VPC to allow access to the on-premises data center through Direct Connect would affect the entire VPC's routing, potentially exposing other resources to the on-premises network.

Option D is incorrect because creating an Elastic IP address and sending traffic through it without an elastic network interface is not a valid configuration for accessing resources in a private subnet.

     To ensure that an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) application has permission to access Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), the correct solution is to create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the necessary S3 permissions and specify that role as the taskRoleArn in the task definition for the ECS application.

Option B, creating an IAM role with S3 permissions and specifying that role as the taskRoleArn in the task definition, is the correct solution to meet the requirement.

       Option A, updating the S3 role in IAM to allow read/write access from ECS and relaunching the container, is not the correct solution because the S3 role is not associated with the ECS application.

Option C, creating a security group that allows access from ECS to S3 and updating the launch configuration used by the ECS cluster, is not the correct solution because security groups are used to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources, and do not grant permissions to access resources.

Option D, creating an IAM user with S3 permissions and relaunching the EC2 instances for the ECS cluster while logged in as this account, is not the correct solution because it is generally considered best practice to use IAM roles rather than IAM users to grant permissions to resources.

     Option B: Create an IAM role with S3 permissions and specify that role as the taskRoleArn in the task definition. This approach allows the ECS task to assume the specified role and gain the necessary permissions to access Amazon S3.

Option A is incorrect because updating the S3 role in IAM and relaunching the container does not associate the updated role with the ECS task.

Option C is incorrect because creating a security group that allows access from Amazon ECS to Amazon S3 does not grant the necessary permissions to the ECS task.

Option D is incorrect because creating an IAM user with S3 permissions and relaunching the EC2 instances for the ECS cluster does not associate the IAM user with the ECS task.

     Option B: Configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. This service provides a fully managed Windows file system that can be easily shared across multiple EC2 Windows instances. It offers high performance and supports Windows applications that require file storage.

Option A is incorrect because AWS Storage Gateway in volume gateway mode is not designed for shared file systems.

Option C is incorrect because while Amazon EFS can be mounted to multiple instances, it is a Linux-based file system and may not be suitable for Windows applications.

Option D is incorrect because attaching and mounting an Amazon EBS volume to multiple instances simultaneously is not supported.

     A. Configure AWS Storage Gateway in volume gateway mode. Mount the volume to each Windows instance.

This option is incorrect because AWS Storage Gateway is not a file storage service. It is a hybrid storage service that allows you to store data in the cloud while maintaining low-latency access to frequently accessed data. It is designed to integrate with on-premises storage systems, not to provide file storage for Amazon EC2 instances.

B. Configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Mount the Amazon FSx file system to each Windows instance.

This is the correct answer. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed file storage service that provides a native Windows file system that can be accessed over the SMB protocol. It is specifically designed for use with Windows-based applications, and it can be easily integrated with existing applications by mounting the file system to each EC2 instance.

       C. Configure a file system by using Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Mount the EFS file system to each Windows instance.

This option is incorrect because Amazon EFS is a file storage service that is designed for use with Linux-based applications. It is not compatible with Windows-based applications, and it cannot be accessed over the SMB protocol.

D. Configure an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume with the required size. Attach each EC2 instance to the volume. Mount the file system within the volume to each Windows instance.

This option is incorrect because Amazon EBS is a block storage service, not a file storage service. It is designed for storing raw block-level data that can be accessed by a single EC2 instance at a time. It is not designed for use as a shared file system that can be accessed by multiple instances.

A.(O) multi-az &lt;= 'little intervention'
B.(X) read replica &lt;= Promoting a read replica to be a standalone DB instance
You can promote a read replica into a standalone DB instance. When you promote a read replica, the DB instance is rebooted before it becomes available.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html
C.(X) use Amazon ECS instead of EC2-based docker for little human intervention
D.(O) Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate : AWS Fargate is a technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances.
E.(X) EC2 launch type
The EC2 launch type can be used to run your containerized applications on Amazon EC2 instances that you register to your Amazon ECS cluster and manage yourself.

     The correct answers are A and D.

A) Creating an RDS DB instance in Multi-AZ mode provides automatic failover to a standby replica in another Availability Zone, providing high availability.

D) Using ECS Fargate removes the need to provision and manage EC2 instances, allowing the service to scale dynamically based on demand. ECS handles load balancing and availability out of the box.

     A. Create an Amazon RDS DB instance in Multi-AZ mode. This ensures that the database is highly available with automatic failover to a standby replica in another Availability Zone.

D. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with a Fargate launch type to handle the dynamic application load. Fargate abstracts the underlying infrastructure, automatically scaling and managing the containers, making it a highly available and low-maintenance option.

Option B is not the best choice as it only creates replicas in another Availability Zone without the automatic failover capability provided by Multi-AZ mode.

Option C is not the best choice as managing a Docker cluster on EC2 instances requires more manual intervention compared to using the serverless capabilities of Fargate in option D.

Option E is not the best choice as it uses the EC2 launch type, which requires managing and scaling the EC2 instances manually. Fargate, as mentioned in option D, provides a more automated and scalable solution.

       Answer A is not an answer because it requires more mannual efford. While AWS Transfer Family simplifies the setup of an SFTP server, it still requires management and monitoring. This includes handling scaling, backups, patching, and other administrative tasks associated with managing an SFTP server.

     The key advantages of AWS Transfer Family are:
It provides a fully managed file transfer service that eliminates the need to manage your own file transfer infrastructure. This reduces operational overhead.
It supports multiple protocols like SFTP, FTPS, FTP and AS2, allowing easy and secure exchange of data with business partners and customers.
File transfers happen directly into Amazon S3 buckets or Amazon EFS file systems, so the transferred data can be easily accessed by other AWS services for analytics, processing etc.
AWS Transfer Family maintains existing client-side configurations, so file transfer workflows remain unchanged for end users and partners.
It provides high availability and auto-scaling capabilities to handle varying transfer workloads.

     AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that makes it easy to set up and manage secure file transfers. It provides a high-availability SFTP server that can be accessed from the public internet. However, this solution does not minimize operational overhead, as it requires the solutions architect to manage the SFTP server.

     This solution provides a highly available SFTP solution without the need for manual management or operational overhead. AWS Transfer Family allows you to easily set up an SFTP server with authentication, authorization, and integration with S3 as the storage backend.

Option B is not the best choice as it suggests using Amazon S3 File Gateway, which is primarily used for file-based access to S3 storage over NFS or SMB protocols, not for SFTP access.

Option C is not the best choice as it requires manual management of an EC2 instance, VPN setup, and cron job script for uploading files, introducing operational overhead and potential complexity.

Option D is not the best choice as it also requires manual management of EC2 instances, Network Load Balancer, and cron job scripts for file uploads. It is more complex and involves additional components compared to the simpler and fully managed solution provided by AWS Transfer Family in option A.

     Originally answered B and C due to least operational overhead. after research its bugging me that the s3 key rotation is determined based on AWS master Key rotation which cannot guarantee the key is rotated with in a 365 day period. stated as "varies" in the documentation. also its impossible to configure this in the console. 
KMS-C is a tick box in the console to turn on annual key rotation but requires more operational overhead than SSE-S3. 
C - will not guarantee the questions objectives but requires little overhead.
D - will guarantee the questions objective with more overhead.

       I‘d have to disagree on that. It states here that aws managed keys are rotated every year which is what the question asks: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html so C would be correct.
However, it also states that you cannot enable or disable rotation for aws managed keys which would again point towards D

     S3 Object Lock can help prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.
In compliance mode, a protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account.

     B. Using S3 Object Lock in compliance mode ensures that the documents cannot be substituted or deleted during the specified retention period, which in this case is 5 years. This helps meet the requirement of ensuring the documents remain immutable for the duration of the contract.

D. Using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed keys allows for encryption of the documents at rest. Additionally, configuring key rotation for the customer managed keys ensures that the encryption keys are automatically rotated every year, meeting the requirement of rotating encryption keys automatically.

     The best option to encrypt data at rest in Amazon S3 and rotate the keys every year is to use AWS KMS (Key Management Service).

With AWS KMS:

You can create a customer master key (CMK) and schedule automatic key rotation every year. This ensures the data is encrypted with a new key annually.

When storing objects in S3, you can choose server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). This will encrypt the data with the CMK you created.

Even if the encrypted data is copied or transferred, it will remain encrypted since the keys are managed by KMS.

You have full control over the keys and can define IAM policies for key access.

AWS manages the encryption, key operations and auditing through integrated services like CloudTrail.

It provides an end-to-end encryption solution within AWS without needing to handle encryption/decryption yourself.

     A - Governance mode allows exceptions
B - Yes
C - SSE-S3 rotates keys when AWS thinks is right, not when customer wants ("every year")
D - Yes
E - "customer provided (imported) keys" can obviously not be 'rotated automatically', the customer would have to provide/import new keys.

       KMS indeed rotates keys every year, but the reason why C is wrong is that the Amazon managed keys can't be configured to rotate or not.

     Question might be outdated.
Amazon S3 now automatically applies server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) as the default encryption for all buckets since January 5, 2023. 
Additionally, it encrypts the key itself with another key that undergoes regular rotation, enhancing security.
Regarding key rotation, the document specifies that the key used to encrypt the S3 Encryption Key undergoes regular rotation. However, it does not explicitly mention the rotation frequency or the ability to customize it.
Therefore, considering the requirement for key rotation and the lack of explicit details about rotation frequency, options B and D would be suitable choices.

     B. Provides a highly available and managed solution with minimum operational overhead. By deploying the web application to EBS, the infrastructure and platform management are abstracted, allowing easy deployment and scalability. With URL swapping, different environments can be created for testing new site features, and traffic can be routed between these environments without any downtime.

A. Suggests using S3 for static content hosting and Lambda for dynamic content. While it offers simplicity for static content, it does not provide the necessary flexibility and dynamic functionality required by a Java and PHP-based web application.

C. Involves manual management of EC2, ASG, and ELB, which requires more operational overhead and may not provide the desired level of availability and ease of testing.

D. Introduces containerization, which adds complexity and operational overhead for managing containers and infrastructure, making it less suitable for a requirement of minimum operational overhead.

     B - Because AWS Elastic Beanstalk performs an in-place update when you update your application versions, your application might become unavailable to users for a short period of time. To avoid this, perform a blue/green deployment. To do this, deploy the new version to a separate environment, and then swap the CNAMEs of the two environments to redirect traffic to the new version instantly.

     A and C are not allowing for feature testing.
B and D allow feature testing. D requires overhead of containerisation as well as the LB controller to selectively chose containers for features (assuming on how this might be implemented). EBS allows switching between environment like A/B testing but on whole site. Expensive but cost is not a concern for this question.

     WS Elastic Beanstalk supports multiple environments, but each environment can only run one platform at a time. A platform is a combination of an operating system, runtime, and web server, and in this case, Java and PHP would be considered different platforms.

So, if you want to use both Java and PHP, you would need to create two separate environments, one for each. You can then link these environments together using AWS services like Route 53 for routing traffic, or use an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic between the two environments.

     B is the correct answer.

Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides a fully managed platform to deploy the web application. Elastic Beanstalk will handle provisioning EC2 instances, load balancing, auto scaling, and application health monitoring.

Elastic Beanstalk's ability to support multiple environments and swap URLs allows easy testing of new features before swapping into production. This requires minimal overhead compared to managing infrastructure directly.

- Multiple Elastic Beanstalk environments can be created easily for development, testing and production use cases. 
- Traffic can be routed between environments for A/B testing and feature iteration using simple URL swapping techniques. No complex routing rules or infrastructure changes required.

     The correct answer to this question is A: Create a read replica. Move reporting queries to the read replica. This solution is designed to alleviate the load on the primary database used by the ordering application. By offloading the reporting queries to a read replica, the primary instance is freed up to handle operational transactions like order processing without contention from the resource-intensive reporting queries. This should effectively reduce or eliminate the timeouts currently experienced during order processing.

This helps eliminate timeouts during order processing while allowing employees to perform their queries without impacting the application's performance.

B. While this can provide some level of load distribution, it does not specifically address the issue of timeouts caused by reporting queries during order processing.

C. While DynamoDB offers scalability and performance benefits, it may require significant changes to the application's data model and querying approach.

D. While this approach can help alleviate the impact on order processing, it does not address the requirement of eliminating timeouts without preventing employees from performing queries.

     A is the correct answer.

Creating an RDS MySQL read replica will allow the reporting queries to be isolated and run without affecting performance of the primary ordering application.

Read replicas allow read-only workloads to be scaled out while eliminating contention with the primary write workload.

     Creating a read replica allows the company to offload the reporting queries to a separate database instance, reducing the load on the primary database used for order processing. By moving the reporting queries to the read replica, the ordering application running on the primary DB instance can continue to process orders without timeouts due to the long-running reporting queries.

Option B is not a good solution because distributing the ordering application to the primary DB instance and the read replica does not address the issue of long-running reporting queries causing timeouts during order processing.

E is correct because using Lambda functions triggered by uploads provides a serverless approach to automatically process each document. Amazon Textract and Comprehend Medical can extract text and medical information without needing to manage server

     B is correct because it suggests writing the document information to an Amazon S3 bucket, which provides scalable and durable object storage. Using Amazon Athena, the data can be queried using SQL, enabling efficient analysis.

E is correct because it involves creating an AWS Lambda function triggered by new document uploads. Amazon Textract is used to convert the documents to raw text, and Amazon Comprehend Medical extracts relevant medical information from the text.

A is incorrect because writing the document information to an Amazon EC2 instance with a MySQL database is not a scalable or efficient solution for analysis.

C is incorrect because creating an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances for processing scanned files and extracting information would introduce unnecessary complexity and management overhead.

D is incorrect because using an EC2 instance with a MySQL database for storing document information is not the optimal solution for scalability and efficient analysis.

       Where is the high availability when the database fails and the cache time runs out?
The answer is a.

         Elasticache for Redis ensures high availability by using read replicas and Multi AZ with failover. It is also faster since it uses cache.

       Caching Frequently Accessed Data: ElastiCache allows you to store frequently accessed or computationally expensive data in-memory within the cache nodes. This means that when an application requests data, ElastiCache can provide the data directly from the cache without having to query the RDS database. This reduces the number of reads on the RDS database because the data is retrieved from the faster in-memory cache.

       Why "only reduce the number of DB reads"? This is exactly what is asked.

Elasticache for Redis can be HA (contrary to Elasticache for Memcached).

You have to use a caching to 'reduce' database reads so read replica is out of option.

     A. Add Amazon RDS read replicas.

Amazon RDS read replicas allow you to create one or more read-only copies of your RDS database instance. By offloading read traffic to read replicas, you can distribute the workload across multiple database instances, reducing the load on the primary database and decreasing the number of reads it needs to handle. This helps to improve the overall performance and scalability of your application.

     The question states that it is a critical app and it has to be HA. A could be the answer, but it's in the same AZ, so if the entire region fails, it doesn't cater for the HA requirement. 

However, the likelihood of a failure in two different regions at the same time is 0. Therefore, to me it seems that C is the better option to cater for HA requirement.

In addition, C does state like A that the DB app is installed on an EC2 instance.

       Option C proposes launching two EC2 instances in different AWS Regions and setting up database replication, with failover to a second Region. While this solution does provide geographic redundancy, it may introduce higher latency due to cross-region communication and data replication. Additionally, failover to a different Region typically involves more complex configurations and longer recovery times compared to failover within the same Region.

While Option C may offer a level of redundancy, it might not provide the same level of responsiveness and automatic failover capabilities as Option A, which leverages Availability Zones within the same Region. In scenarios where low latency and rapid failover are critical, Option A is often preferred. However, if geographic redundancy is a top priority and the potential trade-offs in latency and failover time are acceptable, Option C could still be a viable solution.

     What does "Configure the EC2 instances as a cluster" mean?   The only "EC2 cluster" that I am aware of is a "cluster placement group".  If that's the case, then all EC2 instances in that cluster must be in the same AZ.  So option A would be invalid then.

     Explanation:

Option C provides a solution that ensures high availability by deploying EC2 instances in different AWS Regions. By setting up database replication and failing over the database to a second Region, you ensure automatic failover if a disruptive event occurs in one Region.

Options A and B focus on high availability within a single AWS Region but don't address automatic failover to a different Region in case of a disruptive event.

Option D uses EC2 automatic recovery, but it doesn't provide a solution for automatic failover to a different Region, which is necessary for ensuring high availability in case of a Region-wide failure.

     Option A suggests deploying two EC2 instances, each in a different Availability Zone within the same AWS Region. This ensures high availability by distributing the instances across multiple physically isolated locations. By installing the database on both EC2 instances and configuring them as a cluster, you create a highly available database setup where one instance can seamlessly take over if the other instance fails.

Additionally, setting up database replication between the instances ensures data consistency and redundancy. If one instance fails, the other instance can continue serving requests without interruption.

     The key reasons are:

Using an Auto Scaling group ensures the EC2 instances that process orders are highly available and scalable.
With SQS, the orders are decoupled from the instances that process them via asynchronous queuing.
If instances fail or go down, the orders remain in the queue until new instances can pick them up. This provides automated resilience.
Any failed processing can retry by resending messages back to the queue

     How does SNS capture the requests after the application fails? Those messages are ephemeral by nature and will not hold the data like SQS would. In theory one could create a subscription based service using SNS to stream the data to a service that could store the request, but why...

     C.
Option D suggests using Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda, which can be part of an event-driven architecture but may not be the best fit for ensuring the automatic processing of orders during system outages. It relies on an additional AWS Systems Manager Run Command step, which adds complexity and may not be as reliable as using SQS for queuing messages.

     Move the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group. Configure the order system to send messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the EC2 instances to consume messages from the queue.

     C is the correct answer.

Using an Auto Scaling group with EC2 instances behind a load balancer provides high availability and scalability.

Sending the orders to an SQS queue decouples the ordering system from the processing system. The EC2 instances can poll the queue for new orders and process them even during an outage. Any failed orders will go back to the queue for reprocessing.

     By moving the EC2 into an ASG and configuring them to consume messages from an SQS, the system can decouple the order processing from the order system itself. This allows the system to handle failures and automatically process orders even if the order system or EC2 experience outages.

A. Using an ASG with an EventBridge rule targeting an ECS task does not provide the necessary decoupling and message queueing for automatic order processing during outages.

B. Moving the EC2 instances into an ASG behind an 
ALB does not address the need for message queuing and automatic processing during outages.

D. Using SNS and Lambda can provide notifications and orchestration capabilities, but it does not provide the necessary message queueing and consumption for automatic order processing during outages. Additionally, using Systems Manager Run Command to send commands for order processing adds complexity and does not provide the desired level of automation.

     To meet the company's requirements of having a resilient solution that can process orders automatically in case of a system outage, the solutions architect needs to implement a fault-tolerant architecture. Based on the given scenario, a potential solution is to move the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group and configure the order system to send messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. The EC2 instances can then consume messages from the queue.

     C. Move the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group. Configure the order system to send messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the EC2 instances to consume messages from the queue.

To meet the requirements of the company, a solutions architect should ensure that the system is resilient and can process orders automatically in the event of a system outage. To achieve this, moving the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group is a good first step. This will enable the system to automatically add or remove instances based on demand and availability.

       However, it's also necessary to ensure that orders are not lost if a system outage occurs. To achieve this, the order system can be configured to send messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. SQS is a highly available and durable messaging service that can help ensure that messages are not lost if the system fails.

Finally, the EC2 instances can be configured to consume messages from the queue, process the orders and then store them in the database on Amazon RDS. This approach ensures that orders are not lost and can be processed automatically if a system outage occurs. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

         Option A is incorrect because it suggests creating an Amazon EventBridge rule to target an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) task. While this may be a valid solution in some cases, it is not necessary in this scenario.

Option B is incorrect because it suggests moving the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and updating the order system to send messages to the ALB endpoint. While this approach can provide resilience and scalability, it does not address the issue of order processing and the need to ensure that orders are not lost if a system outage occurs.

Option D is incorrect because it suggests using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to send messages to an AWS Lambda function, which will then send a command to the EC2 instances to process the messages by using AWS Systems Manager Run Command. While this approach may work, it is more complex than necessary and does not take advantage of the durability and availability of SQS.

     changing my answer to D after researching a bit.

The DynamoDB TTL feature allows you to define a per-item timestamp to determine when an item is no longer needed. Shortly after the date and time of the specified timestamp, DynamoDB deletes the item from your table without consuming any write throughput.

       It's to minimize development effort.
C is not the correct one because it needs to enable Dynamo Streams and configure them to send to Lambda, then create the Lambda code for deleting items.
Besides that, the Lambda is triggered only on new items, and since it's ephemeral, it would have to query items older than 30 days and then delete them.
With D, you just need to make two small changes, and it's done—no extra service, no overhead, and no concern about failing to remove.

     Option D is the most suitable solution to meet the company's requirements while minimizing cost and development effort.

TTL (Time to Live) Attribute: DynamoDB provides a feature called Time to Live (TTL), which allows you to automatically delete items from a table after a specified period. By adding a TTL attribute to each item with a value of the current timestamp plus 30 days, you can let DynamoDB automatically delete items older than 30 days. This eliminates the need for manual deletion efforts or periodic stack redeployment.

Minimal Development Effort
Cost-Effective

     A and B don't solve anything.
Between C and D, C requires more cost due to Lambda executions. D uses the TTL built-in feature so it won't cost extra. Also, D does not require extra development and is a matter of configuration. In old-school developer speak, don't write code if your DBA can do some work!

     DynamoDB Time to Live was designed to handle this kind of requirement where an item is no longer needed. TTL is provided at no extra cost as a means to reduce stored data volumes by retaining only the items that remain current for your workload's needs

     D. Extend the application to add an attribute that has a value of the current timestamp plus 30 days to each new item that is created in the table. Configure DynamoDB to use the attribute as the TTL attribute.

The main reasons are:

Using DynamoDB's built-in TTL functionality is the most direct way to handle data expiration.
It avoids the complexity of triggers, streams, and lambda functions in option C.
Modifying the application code to add the TTL attribute is relatively simple and minimizes operational overhead

     By adding a TTL attribute to the DynamoDB table and setting it to the current timestamp plus 30 days, DynamoDB will automatically delete the items that are older than 30 days. This solution eliminates the need for manual deletion or additional infrastructure components.

A. Redeploying the CloudFormation stack every 30 days and deleting the original stack introduces unnecessary complexity and operational overhead.

B. Using an EC2 instance with a monitoring application and a script to delete items older than 30 days adds additional infrastructure and maintenance efforts.

C. Configuring DynamoDB Streams to invoke a Lambda function to delete items older than 30 days adds complexity and requires additional development and operational effort compared to using the built-in TTL feature of DynamoDB.

     C is absurd. DynamoDB usually is a RDS with high iops (read/write operations on tables), executing a Lambda function eachtime you insert a item will not be cost-effective.It's much better create such a field the question propose, and manage the delete with a SQL delete sentence:

     B. Rehost the application in AWS Elastic Beanstalk with the .NET platform in a Multi-AZ deployment.
E. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate from the Oracle database to Oracle on Amazon RDS in a Multi-AZ deployment.

Rehosting the application in Elastic Beanstalk with the .NET platform can minimize development changes. Multi-AZ deployment of Elastic Beanstalk will increase the availability of application, so it meets the requirement of high availability.

Using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate the database to Amazon RDS Oracle will ensure compatibility, so the application can continue to use the same database technology, and the development team can use their existing skills. It also migrates to a managed service, which will handle the availability, so the team do not have to worry about it. Multi-AZ deployment will increase the availability of the database.

     B) Rehost the application in AWS Elastic Beanstalk with the .NET platform in a Multi-AZ deployment.

E) Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate from the Oracle database to Oracle on Amazon RDS in a Multi-AZ deployment.

The reasons are:

° Rehosting in Elastic Beanstalk allows lifting and shifting the .NET application with minimal code changes. Multi-AZ deployment provides high availability.
° Using DMS to migrate the Oracle data to RDS Oracle in Multi-AZ deployment minimizes changes for the database while achieving high availability.
° Together this "lift and shift" approach minimizes refactoring needs while providing HA on AWS.

     B. This allows the company to migrate the application to AWS without significant code changes while leveraging the scalability and high availability provided by EBS's Multi-AZ deployment.

E. This enables the company to migrate the Oracle database to RDS while maintaining compatibility with the existing application and leveraging the Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

A. would require significant development changes and may not provide the same level of compatibility as rehosting or replatforming options.

C. would still require changes to the application and the underlying infrastructure, whereas rehosting with EBS minimizes the need for modification.

D. would likely require significant changes to the application code, as DynamoDB is a NoSQL database with a different data model compared to Oracle.

     Option D is the correct solution that meets all the requirements:
 º Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with AWS Fargate for compute and Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) for data storage.
The key reasons are:
 º EKS allows running the Kubernetes environment on AWS without changes.
 º Using Fargate removes the need to provision and manage EC2 instances. 
 º DocumentDB provides MongoDB compatibility so the data layer is unchanged.

     Applications are already containerized. Amazon EKS is fully managed kubernetes service.
FarGate = Less overhead of managing infrastructure.
Amazon DocumentDB is MongoDB Compatible.

     This solution allows the company to leverage EKS to manage the K8s cluster and Fargate to handle the compute resources without requiring manual management of EC2 worker nodes. The use of DocumentDB provides a fully managed MongoDB-compatible database service in AWS.

A. would require managing and scaling the EC2 instances manually, which increases operational overhead.

B. would require significant changes to the application code as DynamoDB is a NoSQL database with a different data model compared to MongoDB.

C. would also require code changes to adapt to DynamoDB's different data model, and managing EC2 worker nodes increases operational overhead.

     To minimize operational overhead and avoid making any code or deployment method changes, the company can use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with AWS Fargate for computing and Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) for data storage. This solution allows the company to run the containerized application on EKS without having to manage the underlying infrastructure or make any changes to the application code.

AWS Fargate is a fully-managed container execution environment that allows you to run containerized applications without the need to manage the underlying EC2 instances.

Amazon DocumentDB is a fully-managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads, allowing the company to use the same database platform as in their on-premises environment without having to make any code changes.

     The correct answer is B: Use Amazon Transcribe for multiple speaker recognition. Use Amazon Athena for transcript file analysis.

Amazon Transcribe is a service that automatically transcribes spoken language into written text. It can handle multiple speakers and can generate transcript files in real-time or asynchronously. These transcript files can be stored in Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

Amazon Athena is a query service that allows you to analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using SQL. You can use it to analyze the transcript files and identify patterns in the data.

Option A is incorrect because Amazon Rekognition is a service for analyzing images and videos, not transcribing spoken language.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon Translate is a service for translating text from one language to another, not transcribing spoken language.

Option D is incorrect because Amazon Textract is a service for extracting text and data from documents and images, not transcribing spoken language.

     Tricky or incomplete question..

B is the answer because Transcribe is the right service for processing voice calls.

But 7 years of storage is not covered (should add S3 storage)

And Athena querying is just SQL querying, it cannot help you much to recognize business patterns, for that I would think some text analysis service like Comprehend would be needed. 

Unless... We use Transcribe not only to transcribe, but also to recognize some key words, and then create a DB/S3 record with multiple fields, e.g. if it is a telemarketing questionnaire, record answer for each question. Then SQL querying might be useful.

       "The company wants to query the transcript files" is the requirement. How they will be using the query results "to analyze the business patterns" is not our issue.

The "7 years" are not mentioned in any of the options, but Transcribe stores results in S3.

     Amazon Transcribe provides accurate transcription of audio recordings with multiple speakers, generating transcript files. These files can be stored in Amazon S3. To analyze the transcripts and extract insights, Amazon Athena allows SQL-based querying of the stored files.

A. Amazon Rekognition is for image and video analysis, not audio transcription.

C. Amazon Translate is for language translation, not speaker recognition or transcript analysis. Amazon Redshift may not be the best choice for storing and querying transcript files.

D. Amazon Rekognition is for image and video analysis, and Amazon Textract is for document extraction, not suitable for audio transcription or analysis. Storing the transcript files in S3 is appropriate, but the analysis requires a different service like Amazon Athena.

     KEYWORD: LEAST operational overhead

To control access to the REST API and reduce development efforts, the company can use an Amazon Cognito user pool authorizer in API Gateway. This will allow Amazon Cognito to validate each request and ensure that only authenticated users can access the API. This solution has the LEAST operational overhead, as it does not require the company to develop and maintain any additional infrastructure or code.

Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.

Option D. Configure an Amazon Cognito user pool authorizer in API Gateway to allow Amazon Cognito to validate each request.

     Option D is the best solution with the least operational overhead:

Configure an Amazon Cognito user pool authorizer in API Gateway to allow Amazon Cognito to validate each request.

The key reasons are:

º Cognito user pool authorizers allow seamless integration between Cognito and API Gateway for access control.
º API Gateway handles validating the access tokens from Cognito automatically without any custom code.
º This is a fully managed solution with minimal ops overhead.

     By configuring an Amazon Cognito user pool authorizer in API Gateway, you can leverage the built-in functionality of Amazon Cognito to authenticate and authorize users. This eliminates the need for custom development or managing access keys. Amazon Cognito handles user authentication, securely manages user identities, and provides seamless integration with API Gateway for controlling access to the REST API.

A. Configuring an AWS Lambda function as an authorizer in API Gateway would require custom implementation and management of the authorization logic.

B. Creating and assigning an API key for each user would require additional management and validation logic in an AWS Lambda function.

C. Sending the user's email address in the header and validating it with an AWS Lambda function would also require custom implementation and management of the authorization logic.

Option D, using an Amazon Cognito user pool authorizer, provides a streamlined and managed solution for controlling access to the REST API with minimal operational overhead.

     There is a difference between "Grant Access" (Authentication done by Cognito user pool), and "Control Access" to APIs (Authorization using IAM policy, custom Authorizer, Federated Identity Pool). The question very specifically asks about *Control access to REST APIs* which is a clear case of Authorization and not Authentication. So custom Authorizer using Lambda in API Gateway is the solution.  

Pls refer to this blog: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/building-fine-grained-authorization-using-amazon-cognito-api-gateway-and-iam/

       This answer looks to be entirely wrong 

This article explains how to do what you claim cannot be done: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html

It starts "As an alternative to using IAM roles and policies or Lambda authorizers (formerly known as custom authorizers), you can use an Amazon Cognito user pool to control who can access your API in Amazon API Gateway."

This suggests that Amazon Cognito user pools CAN be used for Authorization, which you say above cannot be done.

Further, it explains how to do this...

"To use an Amazon Cognito user pool with your API, you must first create an authorizer of the COGNITO_USER_POOLS type and then configure an API method to use that authorizer"

So whilst A is a valid approach, it looks like D achieves the same with "the LEAST operational overhead".

     By using Pinpoint, the company can effectively send SMS messages to its mobile app users. Additionally, Pinpoint allows the configuration of journeys, which enable the tracking and management of user interactions. The events generated during the journey, including user responses to SMS, can be captured and sent to an Kinesis data stream. This data stream can then be used for analysis and archiving purposes.

A. Creating an Amazon Connect contact flow is primarily focused on customer support and engagement, and it lacks the capability to store and process SMS responses for analysis.

C. Using SQS is a message queuing service and is not specifically designed for handling SMS responses or capturing them for analysis.

D. Creating an SNS FIFO topic and subscribing a Kinesis data stream is not the most appropriate solution for capturing and storing SMS responses, as SNS is primarily used for message publishing and distribution.

In summary, option B is the best choice as it leverages Pinpoint to send SMS messages and captures user responses for analysis and archiving using an Kinesis data stream.

Amazon Pinpoint is the easiest solution.
Amazon Connect is Contact Centre as a Service so this option is not relevant to the requirement.
SQS and SNS options are overengineered or under engineered for the requirements so natural choice is "B"

     Based on my research Kinesis stream is real time data ingestion, and also stores only event data and not the actual people responses, furthermore there is no requirement to have real time data streaming.  That is probably why I am hesitating agree here with everyone on B and rather choose A.

       no no, there is no SMS, note the question stated all activities through SMS, also Amazon connect flow most likely working on web application UI, but if you see question clearly, this is receiving and sending SMS not through application UI (Web/Mobile App). So for those reason we choose B

     D:
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that enables you to send and receive SMS messages in a cost-effective and highly scalable way. By creating an SNS FIFO topic, you can ensure that the SMS messages are delivered to your users in the order they were sent and that the SMS responses are processed and stored in the same order. You can also configure your SNS FIFO topic to publish SMS responses to an Amazon Kinesis data stream, which will allow you to store and analyze the responses for a year.

Amazon Pinpoint ?¿?¿? NO! 

is not correct solution because while Amazon Pinpoint allows you to send SMS and Email campaigns, as well as handle push notifications to a user base, it doesn't provide SMS sending feature by itself. Furthermore, it's a service mainly focused on sending and tracking marketing campaigns, not for managing two-way SMS communication and the reception of reply.

     To send SMS messages and store the responses for a year for analysis, the company can use Amazon Pinpoint. Amazon Pinpoint is a fully-managed service that allows you to send targeted and personalized SMS messages to your users and track the results.

To meet the requirements of the company, a solutions architect can build an Amazon Pinpoint journey and configure Amazon Pinpoint to send events to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for analysis and archiving. The Kinesis data stream can be configured to store the data for a year, allowing the company to analyze the responses over time.

So, Option B is the correct answer.

Option B. Build an Amazon Pinpoint journey. Configure Amazon Pinpoint to send events to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for analysis and archiving.

     KEYWORD: LEAST operational overhead

To encrypt the data when it is stored in the S3 bucket and automatically rotate the encryption key every year with the least operational overhead, the company can use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). SSE-S3 uses keys that are managed by Amazon S3, and the built-in key rotation behavior of SSE-S3 encryption keys automatically rotates the keys every year.

To meet the requirements of the company, the solutions architect can move the data to the S3 bucket and enable server-side encryption with SSE-S3. This solution requires no additional configuration or maintenance and has the least operational overhead.

Hence, the correct answer is;

Option A. Move the data to the S3 bucket. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use the built-in key rotation behavior of SSE-S3 encryption keys.

       The good answer was B before may 2022, because the rotation schedule for AWS managed keys was 3 years (SSE-S3 is based on it)... 

From may 2022 the schedule rotation is 1 year, then A is now the best answer because there is NO operational task to do: S3 is by default encrypted at rest with SSE-S3 (rotation every year)... So it depends if the question has been updated since 2022

       Option B involves using a customer-managed AWS KMS key and enabling automatic key rotation, but this requires the company to manage the KMS key and monitor the key rotation process. 

Option C involves using a customer-managed AWS KMS key, but this requires the company to manually rotate the key every year, which introduces additional operational overhead. 

Option D involves encrypting the data with customer key material and creating a KMS key without key material, but this requires the company to manage the customer key material and import it into the KMS key, which introduces additional operational overhead.

         But...

For A there is no reference to how often these keys are rotated, and to rotate to a new key, you need to upload it, which is operational overhead. So not only does it not necessarily meet the 'rotate keys every year' requirement, but every year it requires operational overhead.

More importantly, the question states move the objects first, and then configure encryption, but ..."There is no change to the encryption of the objects that existed in the bucket before default encryption was enabled." from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/default-bucket-encryption.html

So A is clearly wrong.

For B, whilst you have to set up KMS once, you then don't have to anything else, which i would say is LEAST operational overhead.

       The order of these events is being ignored here in my opinion. The encryption checkbox needs to be checked before data is moved into the S3 bucket or it will not be encrypted otherwise, you'll have to encrypt manually and reload into S3 bucket. If the box was checked before moving data into S3 then you are good to go !

         Ignoring the new changes that the default encryption is already enabled. I agree that the encryption should be configured before moving the data into the bucket. Otherwise, the existing objects will remain unencrypted.

Correct Answer is B. 

Additionally, where is the reference that SSE-S3 will rotate keys every year (which is the question's requirement).

     SSE-S3 - is free and uses AWS owned CMKs (CMK = Customer Master Key). The encryption key is owned and managed by AWS, and is shared among many accounts. Its rotation is automatic with time that varies as shown in the table here. The time is not explicitly defined.

SSE-KMS - has two flavors:

AWS managed CMK. This is free CMK generated only for your account. You can only view it policies and audit usage, but not manage it. Rotation is automatic - once per 1095 days (3 years),
Customer managed CMK. This uses your own key that you create and can manage. Rotation is not enabled by default. But if you enable it, it will be automatically rotated every 1 year. This variant can also use an imported key material by you. If you create such key with an imported material, there is no automated rotation. Only manual rotation.
SSE-C - customer provided key. The encryption key is fully managed by you outside of AWS. AWS will not rotate it.

     SSE-S3 is powerful for data encryption at rest guys. Each single object is encrypted with a different key. SSE-S3 automatically rotates all keys. However, SSE-S3 does not log any information concerning key encryption or rotation.

     As far as I know, SSE-S3 encryption uses keys which we can't view, nor do we know the rotation period of them.
SSE-S3 and AWS-Managed KMS Keys are not the same:
AWS Managed KMS Keys are rotated every 365 days
AWS Customer-Managed Keys have optional rotation
SSE-S3 Encryption is not either of them, thus A should be eliminated.
Since we do not have an option here to use an AWS-managed KMS key, the only valid option is to use a customer-managed key and enable key rotation.

     Interestingly the answer for this used to be B, and now its A.
After May 2022 AWS changed the rotation schedule for SSE-S3. See documentation here: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html#rotate-aws-managed-keys .

AWS managed keys
AWS KMS automatically rotates AWS managed keys every year (approximately 365 days). You cannot enable or disable key rotation for AWS managed keys.
In May 2022, AWS KMS changed the rotation schedule for AWS managed keys from every three years (approximately 1,095 days) to every year (approximately 365 days).
New AWS managed keys are automatically rotated one year after they are created, and approximately every year thereafter.
Existing AWS managed keys are automatically rotated one year after their most recent rotation, and every year thereafter.

----
If this comes up in the exam, remember ! you can use SSE-S3 for yearly rotation now.

     Option A:
Utilizes server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), which is the simplest and most straightforward way to encrypt data stored in Amazon S3.
SSE-S3 automatically handles key rotation, eliminating the need for manual key rotation.
This solution provides encryption for the data in the S3 bucket without requiring any additional setup or management.
Option B:

Involves setting up a customer managed KMS key, enabling automatic key rotation, and then setting the S3 bucket's default encryption behavior to use the customer managed KMS key.
While this option also provides encryption and automatic key rotation, it involves more setup and management compared to SSE-S3.

     It's A. Because it's said that they need with LEAST operation overhead and S3 Managed Keys can rotate automatically every year without needing the user intervention. For the Customer Managed Keys, you need to do some configuration for that.

     Both A and B are viable answers but A with SSE-S3 is least operational overhead. B will require customer to manage the key.
***HOWEVER*** note that SSE-S£ managed keys are rotated periodically so there is no user control on limiting the rotation to "once a year". For exam, probably read the question with full context and hope there is more detail in the actual exam!

     Now "all AWS managed keys are automatically rotated every year. You cannot change this rotation schedule". However, if you insist that option A also specifies the order of steps then it would be wrong, you'd need to enable encryption BEFORE moving the data to the bucket. But per my understanding of English, the order is not specified, it's just a combination of things you do.

Otherwise B would be the correct answer, but it has more operational overhead than A, at least now. Probably the question is old.

     nowhere in this documentation  states how often the keys are rotated, and only the key that encrypts the S3 encryption key actually gets to rotate.

     I'm voting B 
Each object in s3 using SSE-S3 uses separate key, this key is encrypted using another master key that is regularly rotated but AWS doesn't share how often it happens.

With SSE-KMS you have option to tick: "Automatically rotate this KMS key every year.".

     In 2023 the answer would be A. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html states that S3 automatically uses SSE, and rotates the keys "regularly" which as far as I've understood is yearly

     Option D. Add an Auto Scaling group for the application that sends meeting invitations. Configure the Auto Scaling group to scale based on the depth of the SQS queue.

To resolve the issue of longer delivery times for meeting invitations, the solutions architect can recommend adding an Auto Scaling group for the application that sends meeting invitations and configuring the Auto Scaling group to scale based on the depth of the SQS queue. This will allow the application to scale up as the number of appointment requests increases, improving the performance and delivery times of the meeting invitations.

     By adding an ASG for the application that sends meeting invitations and configuring it to scale based on the depth of the SQS, the system can automatically adjust its capacity based on the number of pending messages in the queue. This ensures that the application can handle increased message load and process the meeting invitations more efficiently, reducing the delay experienced by customers.

A. Adding a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in front of the DynamoDB database would improve read performance for DynamoDB, but it does not directly address the issue of delayed meeting invitations.

B. Adding an API Gateway API in front of the web application that accepts the appointment requests may help with request handling and management, but it does not directly address the issue of delayed meeting invitations.

C. Adding an CloudFront distribution with the web application as the origin would improve content delivery and caching, but it does not directly address the issue of delayed meeting invitations.

       You can manage fine grained using redshift as well - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/achieve-fine-grained-data-security-with-row-level-access-control-in-amazon-redshift/
But, I believe the keyword to look for is "minimize operational overhead", which lakeformation does without duplicating much of the data. Redshift is operational overhead and duplication of data. not sure why the answer is D. i vote C as well.

Registering the S3  in Lake Formation ensures unified access control. This solution reduces operational overhead while providing fine-grained permissions management.

A. Directly writing purchase data to Amazon RDS with RDS access controls lacks comprehensive permissions management for both S3 and RDS data.

B. Periodically copying data from RDS to S3 using Lambda and using AWS Glue and Athena for querying does not offer fine-grained permissions management and introduces data synchronization complexities.

D. Creating an Redshift cluster and copying data from S3 and RDS to Redshift adds complexity and operational overhead without the flexibility of Lake Formation's permissions management capabilities.

     The correct answer is D.
The company uses all the data from various teams so that the teams can do their analysis.
Therefore, it is the best way to separately configure redshift for data warehousing and for all employees to connect to the redshift DB and perform analysis tasks without burdening the operating DB (must minimize operational overhead).

     The question here is whether the solution architect can change the requirement. The requirement says very clear about SFTP which cannot be addressed by option C. But the question also gives very clear hint about OAI which cannot be addressed by option D. Option D also doesn't mention anything about CloudFront which is part of the requirement of the question. 
So, if the requirement cannot be changed, D is the answer; if the requirement can be changed, C is the answer. But if the requirement can be changed, what's the limitation? That will be a Chaos. 
I'm voting C, and curse the question designer.

       "The solutions architect must design the most cost-effective and resilient architecture for website hosting to serve as the CloudFront origin." The solution architect is looking for a solution that can fit with CloudFront as origin! So it doesn't matter that option D does not mention CF, CF is part of the solution!
Having a marketing website on-premise clearly indicates having S3 as static content.
AWS Transfer Family is the way to upload files via FTP to S3!
So the answer is D.

Why not C?
User is already uploading content via FTP, option C is eliminating this option for him and forces using the CLI. The solution from C does not meet the requirements of having FTP.

     Hosting the website in a private S3 provides cost-effective and highly available storage for the static website content. By configuring a bucket policy to allow access from a CloudFront OAI, the S3 can be securely accessed only through CloudFront. This ensures that the website content is served through CloudFront while keeping the S3 private. Uploading website content using the AWS CLI allows for easy and efficient content management.

A. Hosting the website on an Lightsail virtual server would introduce additional management overhead and costs compared to using S3 directly for static content hosting.

B. Using an AWS ASG with EC2 instances and an ALB is not necessary for serving static website content. It would add unnecessary complexity and cost.

D. While using AWS Transfer for SFTP allows for SFTP uploads, it introduces additional costs and complexity compared to directly uploading content to an S3 using the AWS CLI. Additionally, hosting the website content in a public S3 may not be desirable from a security standpoint.

     the option D creating a public S3 bucket could expose the website content to the public, which is a security risk. Using an OAI with a private S3 bucket (as in Option C) is more secure. AWS Transfer for SFTP adds unnecessary complexity unless SFTP specifically is required.

     If you don't want to disable block public access settings for your bucket but you still want your website to be public, you can create a Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve your static website. For more information, see Use an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve a static website in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

     I at first thought D but it is in fact C because 

"D: Create a public Amazon S3 bucket. Configure AWS Transfer for SFTP. Configure the S3 bucket for website hosting. Upload website content by using the SFTP client."  questions says that the company has decided to use Amazon Cloudfront and this answer does not reference using CF and setting S3 as the Origin


"C. Create a private Amazon S3 bucket. Use an S3 bucket policy to allow access from a CloudFront origin access identity (OAI). Upload website content by using the AWS CLI." - mentions CF and the origin and the AWS CLI does infact support transfer by SFTP (which was the part I originally doubted but this link evidences that it does:

     Option C, creating a private Amazon S3 bucket and using an S3 bucket policy to allow access from a CloudFront origin access identity (OAI), would not be the most cost-effective solution. While it would allow the company to use Amazon S3 for storage, it would also require additional setup and maintenance of the OAI, which would add additional cost. Additionally, this solution would not allow the use of SFTP client for uploading content which is the current method used by the company.

       That link contains the exact use case and explains how C can be used. 
Option B requires you to send logs to S3 and use Athena, 2 additional services that are not required, so this does not meet the "LEAST operational overhead?" requirement, since these are extra services requiring management.

     Just took the exam today, most of the questions were from here wish I saw them all to be honest before entering the exam. Anyways, this question was at the exam, I picked option A because as the question stated it wanted two things not one thing only an aplication that CAPTURES API calls and SEND ALERTS WHENEVER Createimage API call is made, OPTION C CLEARLY STATES THAT IN THIS CASE IT WILL ONLYYY LOOK FOR CREATEIMAGE API CALL it will not capture other API calls like the lambda in option A would! Am i the only one that is thinks that or what?  TBH I am not sure about anything in this question but that is why I did not pick option C during the exam.

     On of the requirements is LEAST operational overhead
CloudTrail sends a notification when log files are written to the Amazon S3 bucket. An active account can generate a large number of notifications. If you subscribe with email or SMS, you can receive a large volume of messages. We recommend that you subscribe using Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), which lets you handle notifications programmatically. For more information, see Subscribing a Queue to an Amazon SNS Topic in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide.

     AWS CloudTrail primarily focuses on auditing and recording API calls made in your AWS account. It logs all API requests made via the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. This includes the identity of the caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the caller, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service. This information is useful for security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.

     The company needs to design an application that captures AWS API calls and sends alerts whenever the Amazon EC2 CreateImage API operation is called within the company's account.

With option C, it won't "The company needs to design an application that captures AWS API calls". it only sends the "CreateImage API " event. We need to store the AWS API calls as well.

     EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) is a fully managed event bus service that allows you to monitor and respond to events within your AWS environment. By creating an EventBridge rule specifically for the CreateImage API call, you can easily detect and capture this event. Configuring the target as an SNS topic allows you to send an alert whenever a CreateImage API call occurs. This solution requires minimal operational overhead as EventBridge and SNS are fully managed services.

A. While using an Lambda to query CloudTrail logs and send an alert can achieve the desired outcome, it introduces additional operational overhead compared to using EventBridge and SNS directly.

B. Configuring CloudTrail with an SNS notification and using Athena to query on CreateImage API calls would require more setup and maintenance compared to using EventBridge and SNS.

D. Configuring an SQS FIFO queue as a target for CloudTrail logs and using a function to send an alert to an SNS topic adds unnecessary complexity to the solution and increases operational overhead. Using EventBridge and SNS directly is a simpler and more efficient approach.

     This solution can handle bursts of incoming requests more effectively and reduce the chances of losing requests due to DynamoDB capacity limitations. The Lambda can be configured to retrieve messages from the SQS and write them to DynamoDB at a controlled rate, allowing DynamoDB to handle the requests within its provisioned capacity. This approach provides resilience to spikes in traffic and ensures that requests are not lost during periods of high demand.

A. It limits can help control the request rate, but it may lead to an increase in errors and affect the user experience. Throttling alone may not be sufficient to address the availability issues and prevent the loss of requests.

B. It can improve read performance but does not directly address the availability issues and loss of requests. It focuses on optimizing read operations rather than buffering writes.

C. It may help with querying the user requests efficiently, but it does not directly solve the availability issues or prevent the loss of requests. It is more focused on data retrieval rather than buffering writes.

       DAX is not ideal for the following types of applications:

    Applications that require strongly consistent reads (or that cannot tolerate eventually consistent reads).

    Applications that do not require microsecond response times for reads, or that do not need to offload repeated read activity from underlying tables.

    Applications that are write-intensive, or that do not perform much read activity.

    Applications that are already using a different caching solution with DynamoDB, and are using their own client-side logic for working with that caching solution.

     To address the issue of lost user requests and improve the availability of the API, the solutions architect should use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB. Option D (correct answer)

By using an SQS queue and Lambda, the solutions architect can decouple the API front end from the processing microservices and improve the overall scalability and availability of the system. The SQS queue acts as a buffer, allowing the API front end to continue accepting user requests even if the processing microservices are experiencing high workloads or are temporarily unavailable. The Lambda function can then retrieve requests from the SQS queue and write them to DynamoDB, ensuring that all user requests are stored and processed. This approach allows the company to scale the processing microservices independently from the API front end, ensuring that the API remains available to users even during periods of high demand.

     Why not B? DAX.

"When you're developing against DAX, instead of pointing your application at the DynamoDB endpoint, you point it at the DAX endpoint, and DAX handles the rest. As a read-through/write-through cache, DAX seamlessly intercepts the API calls that an application normally makes to DynamoDB so that both read and write activity are reflected in the DAX cache."

       It is not DAX because of the company's budget restriction associated with the DynamoDB. This is a requirement in the question. DynamoDB charges for DAX capacity by the hour and your DAX instances run with no long-term commitments.

         Using DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB, may improve the write performance of the system, but it does not provide the same level of scalability and availability as using an SQS queue and Lambda. 

Hence, Option B is incorrect.

           Create a security group that allows the resources in your VPC to communicate with the endpoint network interfaces for the VPC endpoint. To ensure that tools such as the AWS CLI can make requests over HTTPS from resources in the VPC to the AWS service, the security group must allow inbound HTTPS traffic.


For Security groups, select the security groups to associate with the endpoint network interfaces for the VPC endpoint. By default, we associate the default security group for the VPC.

     The correct solution to meet the requirements is Option B. A gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 should be created in the Availability Zone where the EC2 instance is located. This will allow the EC2 instance to access the S3 bucket directly, without routing through the public internet. The endpoint should also be configured with appropriate security groups to allow access to the S3 bucket. Additionally, a resource policy should be attached to the S3 bucket to only allow the EC2 instance's IAM role for access.

       Option A is incorrect because an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 would not provide a direct connection between the EC2 instance and the S3 bucket. 

Option C is incorrect because using the nslookup tool to obtain the private IP address of the S3 bucket's service API endpoint would not provide a secure connection between the EC2 instance and the S3 bucket. 

Option D is incorrect because using the ip-ranges.json file to obtain the private IP address of the S3 bucket's service API endpoint is not a secure method to connect the EC2 instance to the S3 bucket.

         There are two types VPC Endpoint:

Gateway endpoint
Interface endpoint

A Gateway endpoint:

1) Helps you to securely connect to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB
2) Endpoint serves as a target in your route table for traffic
3) Provide access to endpoint (endpoint, identity and resource policies)

An Interface endpoint:

1) Help you to securely connect to AWS services EXCEPT FOR Amazon S3 and DynamoDB
2) Powered by PrivateLink (keeps network traffic within AWS network)
3) Needs a elastic network interface (ENI) (entry point for traffic)
        </p>

         An interface VPC endpoint does provide a direct connection between the EC2 instance and the S3 bucket. It enables private communication between instances in your VPC and resources in other services without requiring an internet gateway, a NAT device, or a VPN connection.

Option A , which recommends creating an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 in the subnet where the EC2 instance is located and attaching a resource policy to the S3 bucket to only allow the EC2 instance's IAM role for access, is the correct solution for the given scenario. It meets the requirement to ensure that no API calls and no data are routed through public internet routes and that only the EC2 instance can have access to upload data to the S3 bucket.

     I vote for A, because there is no option to attach security group for gateway vpc endpoint. Apart from that in most cases gateway endpoint is preferable for S3, but this little detail about the security group changes my answer for A. Gateway endpoints uses routing tables instead security groups.

     Interface VPC endpoints are more suited for services that require private connectivity via a network interface. For S3, a Gateway VPC Endpoint is more appropriate and cost-effective since it integrates at the route table level without requiring additional cost per endpoint.

     You associate a gateway endpoint with a VPC and its subnets (so the prefix list can be added to the appropriate routing tables).  You cannot specify an AZ or associate an SG when creating a gateway endpoint.

     It must be Interface VPC endpoint. As the Gateway VPC endpoint requires a S3 pubilc IP address to work:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html

If the bucket has a public IP address, it means the bucket is publicy accessible, which is not the case here.

     im almost certain that the answers in this question are written slightly wrong.
there is no reason (based on the question), for you to select A.
Only EC2 needs access to S3, 99% of the time you'd use a gateway endpoint.

Reasons you might use an interface endpoint are:
- requirement of on-premise access to S3
- requirement of access from another VPC in another region using peering or transit gateway
- requirement of using specific endpoint S3 DNS names
- use of private IPs from your VPC to access S3

based on the above, i believe the answer to be B, its just written incorrectly with the addition of the security groups part.

     The correct answer is A. Use Amazon ElastiCache to manage and store session data.

In order to support distributed session data management in this scenario, it is necessary to use a distributed data store such as Amazon ElastiCache. This will allow the session data to be stored and accessed by multiple EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones, which is necessary for a scalable and highly available architecture.

Option B, using session affinity (sticky sessions) of the ALB, would not be sufficient because this would only allow the session data to be stored on a single EC2 instance, which would not be able to scale across multiple Availability Zones.

Options C and D, using Session Manager and the GetSessionToken API operation in AWS STS, are not related to session data management and would not be appropriate solutions for this scenario.

     ElastiCache is a managed in-memory data store service that is well-suited for managing session data in a distributed architecture. It provides high-performance, scalable, and durable storage for session data, allowing multiple EC2 instances to access and share session data seamlessly. By using ElastiCache, the application can offload the session management workload from the EC2 instances and leverage the distributed caching capabilities of ElastiCache for improved scalability and performance.

Option B, using session affinity (sticky sessions) of the ALB, is not the best choice for distributed session data management because it ties each session to a specific EC2 instance. As the instances scale up and down frequently, it can lead to uneven load distribution and may not provide optimal scalability.

Options C and D are not applicable for managing session data. AWS Systems Manager's Session Manager is primarily used for secure remote shell access to EC2 instances, and the AWS STS GetSessionToken API operation is used for temporary security credentials and not session data management.

- Correct. - Session data is managed at the application-layer, and a distributed cache should be used

B. Use session affinity (sticky sessions) of the ALB to manage session data.
- Wrong. This tightly couples the individual EC2 instances to the session data, and requires additional logic in the ALB. When scale-in happens, the session data stored on individual EC2 instances is destroyed

     A
Amazon ElastiCache to manage and store session data. This solution will allow the application to automatically scale across multiple Availability Zones without losing session data, as the session data will be stored in a cache that is accessible from any EC2 instance. Additionally, using Amazon ElastiCache will enable the company to easily manage and scale the cache as needed, without requiring any changes to the application code. Option C is not correct because,Session Manager from AWS Systems Manager will not provide the necessary support for distributed session data management. Session Manager is a tool for managing and tracking sessions on EC2 instances, but it does not provide a mechanism for storing and managing session data in a distributed environment.

     When the backlog per instance reaches the target value, a scale-out event will happen. Because the backlog per instance is already 150 messages (1500 messages / 10 instances), your group scales out, and it scales out by five instances to maintain proportion to the target value.
Backlog per instance: To calculate your backlog per instance, start with the ApproximateNumberOfMessages queue attribute to determine the length of the SQS queue (number of messages available for retrieval from the queue). Divide that number by the fleet's running capacity, which for an Auto Scaling group is the number of instances in the InService state, to get the backlog per instance.

     C is incorrect as scaling based on the number of "notifications" doesn't make logical sense. This means that both the order collection and fulfilment instances would scale in parallel, but they have clearly said that the collection is processing quickly while the fulfilment is struggling. Therefore, we should scale the pool when there is a backlog building in a respective queue - not just based on the number of incoming requests.

     Decoupling with Amazon SQS: By using Amazon SQS queues for order collection and order fulfillment, the system can decouple the components, ensuring that orders are not lost, even during scaling events. Orders are queued up and processed in a reliable and scalable manner.
Scalability Based on Queue Backlog: By creating a metric based on the backlog per instance calculation, the system can monitor the workload of each instance in the Auto Scaling groups. This allows for dynamic scaling based on the workload, ensuring that additional instances are launched when the backlog increases and terminated when the backlog decreases. Optimization of AWS Resources: This solution optimizes the utilization of AWS resources by dynamically scaling the Auto Scaling groups based on the actual workload, preventing over-provisioning or under-provisioning of instances. It ensures that the system can handle peak traffic efficiently without incurring unnecessary costs.

     D. Provision two Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues: one for order collection and another for order fulfillment. Configure the EC2 instances to poll their respective queue. Create a metric based on a backlog per instance calculation. Scale the Auto Scaling groups based on this metric.

     A. This approach focuses solely on CPU utilization, which may not accurately reflect the scaling needs of the order collection and fulfillment processes. It does not address the need for decoupling and reliable message processing.

B. While this approach incorporates alarms to trigger additional Auto Scaling groups, it lacks the decoupling and reliable message processing provided by using SQS queues. It may lead to inefficient scaling and potential data loss.

C. Although using SQS queues is a step in the right direction, scaling solely based on queue notifications may not provide optimal resource utilization. It does not consider the backlog per instance and does not allow for fine-grained control over scaling.

Overall, option D, which involves using SQS queues for order collection and fulfillment, creating a metric based on backlog per instance calculation, and scaling the Auto Scaling groups accordingly, is the most suitable solution to address the scaling problems while optimizing resource utilization and ensuring reliable message processing.

     D is not correct because it requires more operational overhead and complexity than option C which is simpler and more cost-effective. It uses the existing queue metrics that are provided by Amazon SQS and does not require creating or publishing any custom metrics. You can use target tracking scaling policies to automatically maintain a desired backlog per instance ratio without having to calculate or monitor it yourself.

     The number of instances in your Auto Scaling group can be driven by how long it takes to process a message and the acceptable amount of latency (queue delay). 
The solution is to use a backlog per instance metric with the target value being the acceptable backlog per instance to maintain.

     A is not the quickest solution because CloudTrail primarily focuses on capturing and logging API activity. While it can provide information about resource changes, it may not provide a comprehensive and quick way to identify all the tagged components across multiple services and Regions.

B involves manually querying each service using the AWS CLI, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome, especially when dealing with multiple services and Regions. It is not the most efficient solution for quickly identifying tagged components.

C is focused on analyzing logs rather than directly identifying the tagged components. While CloudWatch Logs Insights can help extract information from logs, it may not provide a straightforward and quick way to gather a consolidated list of all tagged components across different services and Regions.

D is the quickest solution as it leverages the Resource Groups Tag Editor, which is specifically designed for managing and organizing resources based on tags. It offers a centralized and efficient approach to generate a report of tagged components across multiple services and Regions.

     I think it cannot be clearly answered because we know that the 'access pattern is variable and changes rapidly', but ultimately it depends on the total number and volume of accesses. All four options meet the "not increase retrieval time" requirement (even Glacier Instant Retrieval has "the same latency and access time as S3 Standard"). If data would be rarely accessed, B would be cheapest. If it would be constantly accessed, C would be cheapest (we'd pay the Intelligent Tiering fee but it would never move anything to a cheaper tier). Inbetween it would be D.

But I guess the key is Amazon's clear recommendation to use Intelligent Tiering (A) for "unknown or changing access" patterns, which matches the statement in the question.

     Correct Answer A:
When data access pattern is not known then Intelligent-tiering can help by monitoring data-access pattern and move object internally accordingly an still ensure faster retrieval. Also There is no object retrieval fees/changes for S3 Intelligent Tier(So cost savings).

Option C is not a valid answer because name itself says Infrequent Access(IA): S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently.

      Comment:
     </strong>
     Immediate Availability: S3 Standard provides immediate access to the data upon upload. This ensures that the exported database is immediately available for other teams to access without any retrieval delays.

Variable Access Pattern: S3 Standard is designed to handle variable access patterns efficiently. It can accommodate rapid changes in access patterns without any impact on performance or latency.

Retention Period: S3 Standard is suitable for storing data that needs to remain accessible for up to 3 months. It does not have any retrieval fees or delays, making it ideal for this scenario where immediate access is required.

     Feels like half the scenario or answers are missing. Where's the "remove objects after 90 days"? Intelligent Tiering has an upcharge for the provided convenience - does it even make sense, when objects won't remain long enough to be archived? 
Other classes trade storage cost for request costs. Dependent on how often objects are queried, IA might make sense. Even Glacier Instant Retrieval could come out ahead, given minimal access (and it has 90 days minimum storage duration, exact fit for the description).

With no further details provided, this is just throwing darts blindly.

       Given just the uncertain access patterns AND limited storage time, I would argue in favor of simple S3 Standard.
If the question mentioned that the pattern of access varies across objects, but is relatively consistent for the individual objects, intelligent tiering may be worth it. Otherwise you just pay more to have objects monitored for Infrequent Access, and then suddenly become popular after being moved.

     There are 2 viable options A and C. 
The Intelligent tearing(A) might put your data in the archive or Infrequent Acces if it is not used for 80 days and then used as crazy for the last 10 days of the period which will cause delays in retrieval or the costs associated with traffic.
Option C can be optimised with the Time To Live policy of 90 days and will e the most efficient and reliable solution to satisfy the needs.

     By configuring AWS WAF rules and associating them with the ALB, the company can filter and block malicious traffic before it reaches the application. AWS WAF offers pre-configured rule sets and allows custom rule creation to protect against common vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.

Option B does not provide the necessary security and traffic filtering capabilities to protect against application-level attacks. It is more suitable for hosting static content rather than implementing security measures.

Option C is focused on DDoS protection rather than application-level attacks like XSS or SQL injection. While AWS Shield Advanced does not address the specific requirements mentioned in the scenario.

Option D involves maintaining and securing additional infrastructure, which goes against the requirement of reducing responsibility and relying on minimal operational staff.

     Explanation:

Option A:
AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) provides protection against common web exploits by allowing you to create rules that block common attack patterns such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
By associating AWS WAF rules with the ALB, you can protect your application from these types of attacks without managing, updating, and securing servers yourself.
AWS WAF is a managed service, so it reduces the operational overhead for the company.

Option C:

AWS Shield Advanced provides DDoS protection, but it doesn't include application-level protection like AWS WAF does.

     AWS Shield Advanced does not directly protect against XSS (cross-site scripting) or SQL injection attacks. It focuses on defending against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which aim to overwhelm resources and disrupt availability.

     S makes more sense as Shield Advanced (which actually contains WAF) doesn't provide any additional benefits apart from networks protection. WAF will still have to be configured. So just use WAF to fulfil the requirements.

     You need to "configure AWS WAF rules and associate them with the ALB" which is A. AWS Shield Advance INTEGRATES with WAF, so you can manage WAF through Shield Advanced, but still you would need to set it up and configure rules, which C does not mention.

     AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service that simplifies the process of preparing and transforming data for analytics. Using AWS Glue requires minimal development effort compared to the other options.

Option A requires more development effort as it involves writing a Spark application to transform the data. It also introduces additional infrastructure management with the EMR cluster.

Option C requires writing and managing custom Bash scripts for data transformation. It requires more manual effort and does not provide the built-in capabilities of AWS Glue for data transformation.

Option D requires developing and managing a custom Lambda for data transformation. While Lambda can handle the transformation, it requires more effort compared to AWS Glue, which is specifically designed for ETL operations.

Therefore, option B provides the easiest and least development effort by leveraging AWS Glue's capabilities for data discovery, transformation, and output to the transformed data bucket.

     i will go with answer B cause: You can use AWS Glue to write ETL jobs in a Python shell environment. You can also create both batch and streaming ETL jobs by using Python (PySpark) or Scala in a managed Apache Spark environment.
Apache Parquet is built to support efficient compression and encoding schemes. It can speed up your analytics workloads because it stores data in a columnar fashion. Converting data to Parquet can save you storage space, cost, and time in the longer run

     Least development effort means lambda. Glue also works but more overhead and cost. A simple lambda like this https://github.com/ayshaysha/aws-csv-to-parquet-converter/blob/main/csv-parquet-converter.py 
can be used to convert as soon as you see files in s3 bucket.

     S3 provides a single control to automatically encrypt all new objects in a bucket with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS. Unfortunately, these controls only affect new objects.  If your bucket already contains millions of unencrypted objects, then turning on automatic encryption does not make your bucket secure as the unencrypted objects remain. 

For S3 buckets with a large number of objects (millions to billions), use Amazon S3 Inventory to get a list of the unencrypted objects, and Amazon S3 Batch Operations to encrypt the large number of old, unencrypted files.

       Versioning:

When you overwrite an S3 object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. However, this will not remove the old unencrypted versions of the object. If you do not delete the old version of your newly encrypted objects, you will be charged for the storage of both versions of the objects. 

S3 Lifecycle 

If you want to remove these unencrypted versions, use S3 Lifecycle to expire previous versions of objects. When you add a Lifecycle configuration to a bucket, the configuration rules apply to both existing objects and objects added later. C is missing this step, which I believe is what makes B the better choice. B includes the functionality of encrypting the old unencrypted objects via Batch Operations, whereas, Versioning does not address the old unencrypted objects.

     It took me quite some time to do the mental math for realising that the data can't be transferred in 30 days. Also, note the MBps (Megabits) and not Megabytes. 500Mbps is like 60MBps. That's a lame connection to transfer anything!

       well.. standard internet connections are measured in Mbps and 500 Mbps is pretty decent to be fair (by english standards).
even still at that speed it would take you about 4 months to upload 700 TB. So the only option here is to use snowball.

     B and D would use existing 500 mbps Internet connection which cannot transfer more than ca. 160 TB in a month. C would cost a lot, take weeks to deliver, and still not provide more bandwidth. Thus A is the simply the only option, thus also the one with "lowest cost".

     one DataSync agent can use 10GBps and can setup a bandwidth.
So total time  = (700X1000)GB/10GBps = 70000 sec = 19.4 days.
Using Multiple Snowball devices will involve ordering them from AWS, setting them up on your data-center for copy and then incurring the shipping cost for too and fro movement to your AWS cloud.
if time constraint was critical , say 1 week then snowball would have been a viable option. But here we have 30 days, so DataSync will be less costly(takes `19days)

       your math is wrong mate, and they have 0.5Gbps connection, not 10GBps

this is way short of 700TB

     By ordering Snowball devices, the company can transfer the 700 TB of backup data from its data center to AWS. Once the data is transferred to S3, a lifecycle policy can be applied to automatically transition the files from the S3 Standard storage class to the cost-effective Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class.

Option B would require continuous data transfer over the public internet, which could be time-consuming and costly given the large amount of data. It may also require significant bandwidth allocation.

Option C would involve additional costs for provisioning and maintaining the dedicated connection, which may not be necessary for a one-time data migration.

Option D could be a viable option, but it may incur additional costs for deploying and managing the DataSync agent.

Therefore, option A is the recommended choice as it provides a secure and efficient data transfer method using Snowball devices and allows for cost optimization through lifecycle policies by transitioning the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive for long-term storage.

     Q: What is AWS Snowball Edge?

AWS Snowball Edge is an edge computing and data transfer device provided by the AWS Snowball service. It has on-board storage and compute power that provides select AWS services for use in edge locations. Snowball Edge comes in two options, Storage Optimized and Compute Optimized, to support local data processing and collection in disconnected environments such as ships, windmills, and remote factories. Learn more about its features here.

Q: What happened with the original 50 TB and 80 TB AWS Snowball devices?

The original Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer.

Q: Can I still order the original Snowball 50 TB and 80 TB devices?

No. For data transfer needs now, please select the Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices.

       700TB of Data can not be transferred through a 500Mbps link within one month.

Total data that can be transferred in one month = bandwidth x time
= (500 Mbps / 8 bits per byte) x (30 days x 24 hours x 3600 seconds per hour)
= 648,000 GB or 648 TB
This is calculated theoretically with the maximum available situation. Due to a number of factors, the actual total transferred Data may be less than 645 TB.

     Step 1: S3 inventory to get object list
Step 2 (If needed): Use S3 Select to filter
Step 3: S3 object operations to encrypt the unencrypted objects.

On the going object use default encryption.

     By enabling default encryption settings on the S3, all newly added objects will be automatically encrypted. To encrypt the existing objects, the S3 Inventory feature can be used to generate a list of unencrypted objects. Then, an S3 Batch Operations job can be executed to copy those objects while applying encryption.

A. This solution involves creating a new S3 and manually downloading and uploading all existing objects. It requires significant effort and time to transfer millions of objects, making it a less efficient solution.

C. While enabling SSE with AWS KMS is a valid approach to encrypt objects in an S3, it does not address the requirement of encrypting existing objects. It only applies encryption to new objects added to the bucket.

D. Manually modifying each object in the S3 to apply default encryption settings is a labor-intensive and error-prone process. It would require individually selecting and modifying each unencrypted object, which is impractical for a large number of objects.

     A - Extreme amount of effort
B - Should work
C - SSE-KMS is not "least amount of effort" compared to SSE-S3; Turning versioning is not required to achieve the result but on the contrary, it will cause the non-encrypted files to remain as old versions even if you encrypt them in the future.
D - Even more effort as A

     Amazon S3 now configures default encryption on all existing unencrypted buckets to apply server-side encryption with S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) as the base level of encryption for new objects uploaded to these buckets. Objects that are already in an existing unencrypted bucket won't be automatically encrypted.

     S3 provides a single control to automatically encrypt all new objects in a bucket with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS. Unfortunately, these controls only affect new objects. If your bucket already contains millions of unencrypted objects, then turning on automatic encryption does not make your bucket secure as the unencrypted objects remain.

For S3 buckets with a large number of objects (millions to billions), use Amazon S3 Inventory to get a list of the unencrypted objects, and Amazon S3 Batch Operations to encrypt the large number of old, unencrypted files.

       Versioning:

When you overwrite an S3 object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. However, this will not remove the old unencrypted versions of the object. If you do not delete the old version of your newly encrypted objects, you will be charged for the storage of both versions of the objects. 

S3 Lifecycle 

If you want to remove these unencrypted versions, use S3 Lifecycle to expire previous versions of objects. When you add a Lifecycle configuration to a bucket, the configuration rules apply to both existing objects and objects added later. C is missing this step, which I believe is what makes B the better choice. B includes the functionality of encrypting the old unencrypted objects via Batch Operations, whereas, Versioning does not address the old unencrypted objects.

     A, E is perfect the combination. To be more precise, We should add outbound with "outbound TCP port 32768-65535 to destination 0.0.0.0/0." as an ephemeral port due to the stateless of NACL.

     For me it's grammatically unclear whether "port 443" and "port 32768-65535" in answers D and E are referring to the source or destination ports of the outbound traffic. If source ports then it would be D. If destination ports (which seems more likely) then it's E.

"On Windows, the ephemeral port range is usually from 49152 to 65535.
On Linux, it is often from 32768 to 61000."

Thus 32768-65535 would cover both Windows and Linux.

     Option A: Creating a security group that allows inbound traffic on TCP port 443 from all sources (0.0.0.0/0) ensures that the web server can accept incoming HTTPS requests.

Option D: Updating the network ACL to allow inbound traffic on TCP port 443 from all sources (0.0.0.0/0) allows the requests to reach the EC2 instance. Additionally, it is necessary to allow outbound traffic on TCP port 443 to enable responses to clients, which is crucial for HTTPS communication.

Security group is a stateful resource and can understand to allow traffic from source 0.0.0.0/0 with port 443 but ACL is stateless so traffic that is allowed inside the network we must configure the same to go outside the network as well.

"NACLs are stateless, which means that information about previously sent or received traffic is not saved. If, for example, you create a NACL rule to allow specific inbound traffic to a subnet, responses to that traffic are not automatically allowed. This is in contrast to how security groups work. Security groups are stateful, which means that information about previously sent or received traffic is saved. If, for example, a security group allows inbound traffic to an EC2 instance, responses are automatically allowed regardless of outbound security group rules."
A fulfils the security group requirement
E is the only option that explicitly covers outbound traffic and ports. 
D covers outbound destination but given that all traffic is blocked (as per the question) this won't work

     For typical web server scenarios, such as serving content over HTTPS (port 443), you generally do not need to explicitly open outbound ports in the network ACL (NACL) for the return traffic.

     It can't be C, since the current NACL blocks all traffic, including outbound. Need to allow outbound traffic through the NACL.
But E is a bad answer, since ephemeral ports start at 1024, not 32768.

     D is the correct answer.

 "in-memory tasks" =&gt; need the "R" EC2 instance type to archive memory optimization. So we are concerned about C &amp; D. 
Because EC2 instances don't have built-in memory metrics to CW by default. As a result, we have to install the CW agent to archive the purpose.

     It's D, EC2 do not provide by default memory metrics to CloudWatch and require the CloudWatch Agent to be installed on the monitored instances : https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-memory-metrics-ec2/

     how future capacity planning and just do verticall scalling will improve the performance. Question doesn't specify if these EC2 are behind auto scalling so it means they are not. out of all A seems more close to the solution

     B will reduce operational overhead and better solution than keep changing the family. Also, I don't think the exam will require you to remember instance families like M5 and R5

     R5 instances are better optimized for the in-memory workload than M5.
Auto Scaling alone doesn't handle stateful applications well, manual capacity adjustments would still be needed.
Custom latency metrics give better visibility than built-in metrics for capacity planning.

     By replacing the M5 instances with R5 instances, which are optimized for memory-intensive workloads, the application can benefit from increased memory capacity and performance.

In addition, deploying the CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instances allows for the generation of custom application latency metrics, which can provide valuable insights into the application's performance.

This solution addresses the performance issues efficiently by leveraging the appropriate instance types and collecting custom application metrics for better monitoring and future capacity planning.

A. Replacing with T3 instances may not provide enough memory capacity for in-memory tasks.

B. Manually increasing the capacity of the ASG does not directly address the performance issues.

C. Relying solely on built-in EC2 memory metrics may not provide enough granularity for optimizing in-memory tasks.

The most efficient solution is to modify the CloudFormation templates, replace with R5 instances, and deploy the CloudWatch agent for custom metrics.

     Lambda is a serverless compute service that can be triggered by API Gateway to process requests asynchronously. It automatically scales based on the incoming request volume and allows for cost optimization by charging only for the actual compute time used to process the requests.

A. Glue is a fully managed ETL service. It is designed for data processing and transformation tasks rather than serving API requests. It may not be suitable for handling variable request volumes and delivering responses within a few seconds.

C. While EKS provides scalability and flexibility, it may introduce additional complexity and overhead for managing and scaling the infrastructure for handling variable API request volumes.

D. Similar to the previous option, using ECS with EC2 would require additional effort for infrastructure management and scaling, which may not be necessary for handling intermittent and variable API request volumes.

     A. EBS provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. While it offers durability and persistence, it is not the most cost-effective solution for long-term retention of log files. Additionally, it does not provide concurrent access to the files, which is a requirement in this scenario.

B. EFS is a scalable file storage service that can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances concurrently. While it provides concurrent access to files, it may not be the most cost-effective option for long-term retention due to its higher pricing compared to S3.

C. The instance store is a temporary storage option that is physically attached to the EC2 instance. It does not provide the durability and long-term retention required for compliance purposes. Additionally, the instance store is not accessible outside of the specific EC2 instance it is attached to, so concurrent access by the reporting tool would not be possible.

Therefore, considering the requirements for long-term retention, concurrent access, and cost-effectiveness, S3 is the most suitable and cost-effective storage solution.

         actually S3 &lt; EBS &lt; EFS, but for EBS you need to pay for the underlying provisioned GB.
If you compare 1 GB then S3 &lt; EBS &lt; EFS but if you have 100GB storage for EBS than EBS is more expensive.

EFS is a file storage service for use with Amazon compute (EC2, containers, serverless) and on-premises servers. EFS provides a file system interface, file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking), and concurrently accessible storage for up to thousands of EC2 instances.

     By creating an IAM role and delegating access to the vendor's IAM role, you establish a trust relationship between accounts. This allows the vendor's automated tool to assume the role in the company's account and access the necessary resources.

By attaching the appropriate IAM policies to the role, you can define the precise permissions that the vendor requires for their tool to perform its tasks. This ensures that the vendor has the necessary access without granting them direct IAM access to the company's account.

B is incorrect because creating an IAM user with a password would require sharing the credentials with the vendor, which is not recommended for security reasons.

C is incorrect because adding the vendor's IAM user to an IAM group in the company's account would not provide a direct and controlled way to delegate access to the vendor's tool.

D is incorrect because creating a new identity provider for the vendor's AWS account would not provide a straightforward way to delegate access to the vendor's tool. Identity providers are typically used for federated access using external identity systems.

     A. By attaching an IAM role to the EKS pod, you can grant the necessary permissions for the pod to access DynamoDB. The IAM role should have appropriate policies allowing access to the DynamoDB table.

D. Creating a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB allows the EKS pod to access DynamoDB privately within the VPC, without the need for internet connectivity. The VPC endpoint provides a direct and secure connection to DynamoDB, eliminating the need for traffic to flow over the internet.

C is incorrect because configuring outbound connectivity through network ACLs would not provide a secure and direct connection to DynamoDB.

E is incorrect because embedding access keys in the code is not a recommended security practice. It can lead to potential security vulnerabilities. It is better to use IAM roles or other secure mechanisms for providing access to AWS services.

     C. A multivalue answer routing policy in Route 53 allows you to configure multiple values for a DNS record, and Route 53 responds to DNS queries with multiple random values. This enables the distribution of traffic randomly among the available EC2 instances.

E. By launching EC2 instances in different AZs, you achieve high availability and fault tolerance. Launching four instances (two in each AZ) ensures that there are enough resources to handle the traffic load and maintain the desired level of availability.

A. Failover routing is designed to direct traffic to a backup resource or secondary location only when the primary resource or location is unavailable.

B. Although a weighted routing policy allows you to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances, it does not ensure random distribution.

D. While launching instances in multiple AZs is important for fault tolerance, having only three instances does not provide an even distribution of traffic. With only three instances, the traffic may not be evenly distributed, potentially leading to imbalanced resource utilization.

     Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. You can use multivalue answer routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

Weighted routing policy – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify. You can use weighted routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

     B provides a fully managed and scalable solution for data ingestion and analytics. KDF simplifies the data ingestion process by automatically scaling to handle large volumes of streaming data. It can directly load the data into an Redshift cluster, which is a powerful and fully managed data warehousing solution.

A. While Kinesis can handle streaming data, it requires additional processing to load the data into an analytics solution.

C. Although S3 and Lambda can handle the storage and processing of data, it requires more manual configuration and management compared to the fully managed solution offered by KDF and Redshift.

D. This option involves more operational overhead, as it requires managing and scaling the EC2 instances and RDS database infrastructure manually.

Therefore, option B with KDF delivering the data to Redshift cluster offers the most streamlined and operationally efficient solution for ingesting and analyzing the user activity data in the given scenario.

     This solution meets the requirements as follows:
• Kinesis Data Firehose can scale to ingest and process multiple terabytes per hour of streaming data. This can easily handle the petabyte-scale data volumes.
• Firehose can deliver the data to Redshift, a petabyte-scale data warehouse, enabling on-demand SQL analytics of the data.
• Redshift is a fully managed service, minimizing operational overhead. Firehose is also fully managed, handling scalability, availability, and durability of the streaming data ingestion.

     B: The answer is certainly option "B" because ingesting user activity data can easily be handled by Amazon Kinesis Data streams. The ingested data can then be sent into Redshift for Analytics. 

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. Amazon Redshift Serverless lets you access and analyze data without all of the configurations of a provisioned data warehouse.

     B: Kinesis Data Firehose service automatically load the data into Amazon Redshift and is a petabyte-scale data warehouse service. It allows you to perform on-demand analytics with minimal operational overhead. Since the requirement didn't state what kind of analytics you need to run, we can assume that we do not need to set up additional services to provide further analytics. Thus, it has the least operational overhead.

Why not A:  It is a viable solution, but storing the data in S3 would require you to set up additional services like Amazon Redshift or Amazon Athena to perform the analytics.

E. API Gateway can be used to receive the raw data from the remote devices via RESTful web services. It provides a scalable and managed infrastructure to handle the incoming requests. The data can then be sent to an Amazon Kinesis data stream, which is a highly scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. From there, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose can be configured to use the data stream as a source and deliver the transformed data to Amazon S3. This combination of services allows for the seamless ingestion and processing of data while minimizing operational overhead.

B. It does not directly address the need for scalable data processing and storage. It focuses on managing DNS and routing traffic to different endpoints.

C. Adding more EC2 can lead to increased operational overhead in terms of managing and scaling the instances.

D. Using SQS and EC2 for processing data introduces more complexity and operational overhead.

     Why it not CE? 
Add more EC2 instances to accommodate the increasing amount of incoming data?

     This is the most cost-effective option because:
• Versioning has caused the number of objects to increase over time, even as current objects are deleted after 3 years. By deleting previous versions as well, this will clean up old object versions and reduce storage costs.
• An S3 Lifecycle policy incurs no additional charges and requires no additional resources to configure and run. It is a native S3 tool for managing object lifecycles cost-effectively.

     I did something similar recently : Lifecycle is triggered more or less each 24 hours, in my case it removed hundreds of gigabytes and millions of small files in one shot. Using another mechanism like a script would have taken days if not weeks.

     By configuring the S3 Lifecycle policy to delete previous versions as well as current versions, the older versions of the CloudTrail logs will be deleted. This ensures that objects older than 3 years are removed from the S3 bucket, reducing the object count and controlling storage costs.

A. This option is not directly related to managing objects in the S3. It focuses on configuring the expiration of CloudTrail trails, which may not address the need to delete objects from the S3 bucket.

C. While it is technically possible to create a Lambda to delete objects older than 3 years, this approach would introduce additional complexity and operational overhead.

D. Changing the ownership of the objects in the S3 bucket does not directly address the need to delete objects older than 3 years. Ownership does not affect the deletion behavior of the objects.

     A more cost-effective solution would be to configure the organization's centralized CloudTrail trail to expire objects after 3 years. This would ensure that all objects, including previous versions, are deleted after the specified retention period.
Another option would be to create an AWS Lambda function to enumerate and delete objects from Amazon S3 that are older than 3 years, this would allow you to have more control over the deletion process and to write a custom logic that best fits your use case.

       As long as versioning on the S3 bucket is enabled, any deletion, whether performed by CloudTrail or by your custom Lambda function, will simply add a new version with a deletion market but will not delete the previous version.

     The question clearly says "An S3 Lifecycle policy is in place to delete current objects after 3 years". This implies that previous versions are not deleted, since this is a separate setting, and since logs are constantly changed, it would seem to make sense to delete previous versions so, so B. D is wrong, since the parent account (the management account) will already be the owner of all objects delivered to the S3 bucket, "All accounts in the organization can see MyOrganizationTrail in their list of trails, but member accounts cannot remove or modify the organization trail. Only the management account or delegated administrator account can change or delete the trail for the organization.", see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/creating-trail-organization.html

     Ans: A 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/creating-trail-organization.html
When you create an organization trail, a trail with the name that you give it is created in every AWS account that belongs to your organization. Users with CloudTrail permissions in member accounts can see this trail when they log into the AWS CloudTrail console from their AWS accounts, or when they run AWS CLI commands such as describe-trail. However, users in member accounts do not have sufficient permissions to delete the organization trail, turn logging on or off, change what types of events are logged, or otherwise change the organization trail in any way.

SQS can invoke lambda indeed. Initially I picked D because I wasn't sure it was possible but  , this article shows it is. It makes this question even more confusing for me as it is also possible to trigger lambda from SNS:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-lambda-as-subscriber.html
I don't know which option between C and D makes more sense. I still have a preference for D as it seems less hacky than C.

     By leveraging SQS as a buffer and using an Lambda to process and write data from the queue to the database, the solution provides scalability, decoupling, and reliability while minimizing the number of connections to the database. This approach handles fluctuations in traffic and ensures data integrity during high-traffic periods.

A. Increasing the size of the DB instance may provide more memory, but it does not address the issue of handling high write traffic efficiently and minimizing connections to the database.

B. Modifying the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ instance and writing to all active instances can improve availability but does not address the issue of efficiently handling high write traffic and minimizing connections to the database.

D. Using SNS and an Lambda can provide decoupling and scalability, but it is not suitable for handling heavy write traffic efficiently and minimizing connections to the database.

     I think D, "Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SQS invokes to write data from the queue to the database" SQS can't invokes Lambda becouse SQS is pull.

       a) You can't write to multiple instances at the same time
b) If you could, it would probably not increase performance
c) if it would increase performance then it would probably double performance, which might not be enough

Decoupling is the way to go - let clients submit data via APIs, and write it asynchronously to the database. Don't let clients wait until data has been written.

To minimize the number of connections to the database and ensure that data is not lost during periods of heavy traffic, the company should modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon SQS queue. The use of a queue will act as a buffer between the API and the database, reducing the number of connections to the database. And the use of an AWS Lambda function invoked by SQS will provide a more flexible way of handling the data and processing it. This way, the function will process the data from the queue and insert it into the database in a more controlled way.

     Migrating the databases to Aurora Serverless provides automated scaling and replication capabilities. Aurora Serverless automatically scales the capacity based on the workload, allowing for seamless addition or removal of compute capacity as needed. It also offers improved performance, durability, and high availability without requiring manual management of replication and scaling.

B. Incorrect because it suggests migrating to a different database engine, which may introduce compatibility issues and require significant code modifications.

C. Incorrect because consolidating into a larger MySQL database on larger EC2 instances does not provide the desired scalability and automation.

D. Incorrect because using EC2 Auto Scaling groups for the database tier still requires manual management of replication and scaling.

       NAT instances are legacy technology. "If you're already using a NAT instance, we recommend that you replace it with a NAT gateway." Thus C.

     This recommendation ensures high availability and fault tolerance by distributing the NAT gateways across multiple AZs. NAT gateways are managed AWS services that provide scalable and highly available outbound NAT functionality. By deploying NAT gateways in differentAZs, the company can achieve redundancy and avoid a single point of failure. This solution also provides automatic scaling to handle increasing traffic without manual intervention.

Option A is incorrect because placing both NAT gateways in the same Availability Zone does not provide fault tolerance.

Option B is incorrect because using Auto Scaling groups with Network Load Balancers is not the recommended approach for NAT instances.

Option D is incorrect because Spot Instances are not suitable for critical infrastructure components like NAT instances.

     Could anybody teach me why the B cannot be correct answer? This solution also seems providing Scalability(Auto Scaling Group), High Availability(different AZ), and Fault Tolerance(NLB &amp; AZ). 

I honestly think that C is not enough, because each NAT gateway can provide a few scalability, but the bandwidth limit is clearly explained in the document. The C exactly mentioned "two NAT gateways" so the number of NAT is fixed, which will reach its limit soon.

       Option B proposes to use an Auto Scaling group with Network Load Balancers to continue using the existing two NAT instances. However, NAT instances do not support automatic failover without a script, unlike NAT gateways which provide this functionality. Additionally, using Network Load Balancers to balance traffic between NAT instances adds more complexity to the solution.

     C. If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT gateway, and if the NAT gateway's Availability Zone is down, resources in the other Availability Zones lose internet access. To create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html#nat-gateway-basics

     A is correct. B will work but is not the most secure method, since it will allow everything in VPC A to talk to everything in VPC B and vice versa, not at all secure. A on the other hand will only allow the application (since you select it's IP address) to talk to the application server in VPC A - you are allowing only the required connectivity. See the link for this exact use case: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html

         Both VPCs are in the "SAME AWS ACCOUNT" and the requirement specifies allowing traffic from the *PUBLIC IP of the APPLICATION SERVER*. In this case the traffic remains inside the AWS infrastructure or will it go through the public internet?

     B. Configure a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B.

The most secure solution is to configure a VPC peering connection between the two VPCs. This allows private communication between the application server and the database, without exposing resources to the public internet. 

Option A exposes the database to the public internet by allowing inbound traffic from a public IP address.

Option C makes the database instance itself public, which is insecure.

Option D adds complexity with a proxy that is not needed when a VPC peering connection can enable private communication between VPCs.

So option B is the most secure while allowing the necessary connectivity between the application server and the database in the separate VPCs.

     Well this is a tricky one!!! Are we going to assume that the database in VPC B is in private subnet? In that case configuring security group to allow the traffic coming from Elastic IP of VPC A will not work. And if we use peering, the resources that live in the same subnet as the EC2 instance in VPC A will have access to the database? So what would we say to this? Is moving traffic through the public AWS space is safer than allowing access to the DB to other resources in VPC A?..... I don't know what to think

     When you establish peering relationships between VPCs across different AWS Regions, resources in the VPCs (for example, EC2 instances and Lambda functions) in different AWS Regions can communicate with each other using private IP addresses, without using a gateway, VPN connection, or network appliance. The traffic remains in the private IP space. All inter-Region traffic is encrypted with no single point of failure, or bandwidth bottleneck. Traffic always stays on the global AWS backbone, and never traverses the public internet, which reduces threats, such as common exploits, and DDoS attacks. Inter-Region VPC peering provides a simple and cost-effective way to share resources between regions or replicate data for geographic redundancy.

     By configuring a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B, you can establish private and secure communication between the EC2 instance in VPC A and the database in VPC B. VPC peering allows traffic to flow between the two VPCs using private IP addresses, without the need for public IP addresses or exposing the database to the internet.

Option A is not the best solution as it requires allowing all traffic from the public IP address of the application server, which can be less secure.

Option C involves making the DB instance publicly accessible, which introduces security risks by exposing the database directly to the internet.

Option D adds unnecessary complexity by launching an additional EC2 instance in VPC B and proxying all requests through it, which is not the most efficient and secure approach in this scenario.

     I don't like A because the security group setting is wrong as it set up to allow all public IP addresses. If the security group setting is correct, then I will go for A
I don't like B because it need to set up security group as well on top of peering.
for exam purpose only, I will go with the least worst choice which is B

     Each VPC security group rule makes it possible for a specific source to access a DB instance in a VPC that is associated with that VPC security group. The source can be a range of addresses (for example, 203.0.113.0/24), or another VPC security group.

     By publishing VPC flow logs to CloudWatch Logs and creating metric filters to detect RDP or SSH access, the operations team can configure an CloudWatch metric alarm to notify them when the alarm is triggered. This will provide the desired notification when RDP or SSH access to an environment is established.

Option A is incorrect because CloudWatch Application Insights is not designed for detecting RDP or SSH access.

Option B is also incorrect because configuring an IAM instance profile with the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy does not directly address the requirement of notifying the operations team when RDP or SSH access occurs.

Option D is wrong beacuse configuring an EventBridge rule to listen for EC2 Instance State-change Notification events and using an SNS topic as a target will notify the operations team about changes in the instance state, such as starting or stopping instances. However, it does not specifically detect or notify when RDP or SSH access is established, which is the requirement stated in the question.

     C sounds complex, but is the only answer that can work.
Not A - Application Insights has nothing to do with SSH/RDP access to the OS; also we need a notification, not an OpsItem
Not B - Just attaching a role does not create a notification
Not D - Establishing SSH/RDP access is not a "state change" that would trigger this

     A bit clueless here. AWS-recommended approach involves the CloudWatch Logs Agent on each EC2 instance, but that is not involved in any of the answers.

A: Sounds good at first read, but "CloudWatch Application Insights" cannot detect RDP or SSH access. 

B: Would allow RDP or SSH access via Systems Manager, but would NOT prevent access without Systems Manager; also we'd need to configure notifications in Systems Manager which is not mentioned here.

       C: Could work but it seems overkill to capture VPC flow logs just to detect SSH and RDP traffic. Also it is not real-time, and it's unclear how and when exactly the state transitions and notifications will be triggered. At best you'd get notification few minutes AFTER (not "when") "access has been established". Still, is has most similarity with the recommended approach to detect failed connections: https://aws.amazon.com/tr/blogs/security/how-to-monitor-and-visualize-failed-ssh-access-attempts-to-amazon-ec2-linux-instances/

D: Won't work because establishment of a connection is not an instance state change.

     VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to the following locations: Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. After you create a flow log, you can retrieve and view the flow log records in the log group, bucket, or delivery stream that you configured.

Flow logs can help you with a number of tasks, such as:

    Diagnosing overly restrictive security group rules

    Monitoring the traffic that is reaching your instance

    Determining the direction of the traffic to and from the network interfaces

     D. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule to listen for events of type EC2 Instance State-change Notification. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as a target. Subscribe the operations team to the topic. This setup allows the EventBridge rule to capture instance state change events, such as when RDP or SSH access is established. The rule can then send notifications to the specified SNS topic, which is subscribed by the operations team.

     A. Configuring Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights to create AWS Systems Manager OpsItems when RDP or SSH access is detected would be the most appropriate solution in this scenario. This would allow the operations team to be notified when RDP or SSH access has been established and provide them with the necessary information to take action if needed. Additionally, Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights would allow for monitoring and troubleshooting of the system in real-time.

     EC2 Instance State-change Notifications are not the same as RDP or SSH established connection notifications. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor SSH access to your Amazon EC2 Linux instances so that you can monitor rejected (or established) SSH connection requests and take action.

     The Answer can be A or C depending on the requirement if it requires real-time notification.
A:  Allows the operations team to be notified in real-time when access is established, and also provides visibility into the access events through the OpsItems.

C:  The logs will need to be analyzed and metric filters applied to detect access, and then the alarm will trigger based on that analysis. This method could have a delay in providing notifications. Thus, not the best solution if real-time notification is required.

Why not D: RDP or SSH access does not cause an EC2 instance to have a state change. The state change events that Amazon EventBridge can listen for include stopping, starting, and terminated instances, which do not apply to RDP or SSH access. But RDP or SSH connection to an EC2 instance does generate an event in the system, such as a log entry which can be used to notify the Operation team. Since its a log, you would require a service that monitors logs like CloudTrail, VPC Flow logs, or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.

       I completely agree with the logic here, but I'm thinking C, since I believe you will need to "Create required metric filters" in order to detect RDP or SSH access, and this is not specified in the question, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-create-OpsItems-from-CloudWatch-Alarms.html

     D. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule to listen for events of type EC2 Instance State-change Notification. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as a target. Subscribe the operations team to the topic.

EC2 instances sends events to the EventBridge when state change occurs, such as when a new RDP or SSH connection is established, you can use EventBridge to configure a rule that listens for these events and trigger an action, like sending an email or SMS, when the connection is detected. The operations team can be notified by subscribing to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, which can be configured as the target of the EventBridge rule.

     A. Setting a strong password for the root user is an essential security measure to prevent unauthorized access.

B. Enabling MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional authentication factor, such as a code from a mobile app or a hardware token, in addition to the password.

C. Root user access keys should be avoided whenever possible, and it is best to use IAM users with restricted permissions instead.

D. The root user already has unrestricted access to all resources and services in the account, so granting additional administrative permissions could increase the risk of unauthorized actions.

E. Instead, it is recommended to create IAM users with appropriate permissions and use those users for day-to-day operations, while keeping the root user secured and only using it for necessary administrative tasks.

     A and B are the correct answers: 

Option A: A strong password is always required for any AWS account you create, and should not be shared or stored anywhere as there is always a risk. 

Option B: This is following AWS best practice, by enabling MFA on your root user which provides another layer of security on the account and unauthorised access will be denied if the user does not have the correct password and MFA.

     B. Enabling multi-factor authentication for the root user provides an additional layer of security to ensure that only authorized individuals are able to access the root user account.
E. Applying the required permissions to the root user with an inline policy document ensures that the root user only has the necessary permissions to perform the necessary tasks, and not any unnecessary permissions that could potentially be misused.

       The other options are not sufficient to secure the root user access because:
A. A strong password alone is not enough to protect against potential security threats such as phishing or brute force attacks.
C. Storing the root user access keys in an encrypted S3 bucket does not address the root user's authentication process.
D. Adding the root user to a group with administrative permissions does not address the root user's authentication process and does not provide an additional layer of security.

     AWS KMS can be used to encrypt the EBS and Aurora database storage at rest.
ACM can be used to obtain an SSL/TLS certificate and attach it to the ALB. This encrypts the data in transit between the clients and the ALB.

A is incorrect because it suggests using ACM to encrypt the EBS, which is not the correct service for encrypting EBS.

B is incorrect because relying on the AWS root account and selecting an option in the AWS Management Console to enable encryption for all data at rest and in transit is not a valid approach.

D is incorrect because BitLocker is not a suitable solution for encrypting data in AWS services. It is primarily used for encrypting data on Windows-based operating systems. Additionally, importing TLS certificate keys to AWS KMS and attaching them to the ALB is not the recommended approach for encrypting data in transit.

     To encrypt data at rest, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) can be used to encrypt EBS volumes and Aurora database storage.

To encrypt data in transit, an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate can be attached to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to enable HTTPS and TLS encryption.

     B. Use AWS DataSync for the initial migration. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create a full load plus change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select all tables.

This approach leverages AWS DataSync for the initial data migration, which is optimized for high-speed transfer of large amounts of data. Then, AWS DMS is used to create a replication task with full load plus change data capture (CDC), ensuring ongoing synchronization between the on-premises Oracle database and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. By selecting all tables, the migration process ensures that all applications can continue to read from and write to the database without interruption during the migration period.

     The AWS SCT is used to convert the schema and code of the Oracle database to be compatible with Aurora PostgreSQL. AWS DMS is utilized to migrate the data from the Oracle database to Aurora PostgreSQL. Using a memory-optimized replication instance is recommended to handle the high number of reads and writes during the migration process.
By creating a full load plus CDC replication task, the initial data migration is performed, and ongoing changes in the Oracle database are continuously captured and applied to the Aurora PostgreSQL database. Selecting all tables for table mapping ensures that all the applications writing to the same tables are migrated.

Option A &amp; B are incorrect because using AWS DataSync alone is not sufficient for database migration and data synchronization.

Option D is incorrect because using a compute optimized replication instance is not the most suitable choice for handling the high number of reads and writes.

     B and D very similar with D being the 'best' solution but it is not the one that requires the least amount of development changes as the application would need to be changed to store images in S3 instead of DB

       B is wrong because single "RDS DB instance" is not HA.

No one says that the images are currently stored in S3. Also the requirement is "least amount of change [not "no change"] to the application".

     A: Requires changing EC2 application to Lambda. Seems like a big change
B: RDS DB is not best option for serve images and also single instance isn't HA
C: Memory optimised instance is not HA
D: Multi-AZ EBS is lift and shift for EC2 front-end and app later. RDS Multi AZ is HA. S3 for static images is best performance/scalability/availability.

     Using Amazon RDS for serving images might not be the optimal solution, as RDS is more suitable for storing structured data in a relational database rather than BLOBs like images. Storing and serving images can be more efficiently handled by object storage services like Amazon S3.

     Option B - DB is not a good option to store images. Read replicas won't improve HA for write, only scalates reading IO. Therefore no true HA achieved.

     Use Elastic Beanstalk load-balanced environments for the web and app tiers. This provides auto scaling and high availability with minimal effort.
Move the database to RDS Multi-AZ. This handles scaling reads and storage, and provides HA with automated failover.
Use S3 for serving user images. S3 is highly scalable and durable storage.
The application code remains unchanged using this approach.

     AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it even easier for developers to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud. Developers simply upload their application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.

I don't quite understand why people choose D.

     By using load-balanced Multi-AZ AWS EBS, you achieve scalability and high availability for both layers without requiring significant changes to the application. Moving the DB to an RDS Multi-AZ DB ensures high availability and automatic failover. Storing and serving users' images through S3 provides a scalable and highly available solution.

A is incorrect because using S3 for the front-end layer and Lambda for the application layer would require significant changes to the application architecture. Moving the DB to DynamoDB would require rewriting the DB-related code.

B is incorrect because using load-balanced Multi-AZ AWS EBS environments and an RDS DB with read replicas for serving images would be a more suitable solution. RDS with read replicas can handle the image-serving workload more efficiently than using S3 for this purpose.

C is incorrect because using S3 for the front-end layer and an ASG of EC2 for the application layer would require modifying the application architecture. Storing and serving images from a memory-optimized EC2 type may not be the most efficient and scalable approach compared to using S3.

     "least amount of change to the application." - A has lots of changes, completely revamping the application and lots of new pieces. D is closest with only addition of s3 to store images which is right move. You do not want images to store in any database anyway.

     AWS uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC to create a VPC peering connection; it is neither a gateway nor a VPN connection, and does not rely on a separate piece of physical hardware. There is no single point of failure for communication or a bandwidth bottleneck.

     A VPC peering connection allows secure communication between instances in different VPCs using private IP addresses without the need for internet gateways, VPN connections, or NAT devices. By setting it up, the application running in VPC-A can directly access the EC2 in VPC-B without going through the public internet or any single point of failure.

B is incorrect because VPC gateway endpoints are used for accessing S3 or DynamoDB from a VPC without going over the internet. They are not designed for establishing connectivity between EC2 instances in different VPCs.

C is incorrect because it would require configuring a VPN connection between the VPCs. This would introduce additional complexity and potential single points of failure.

D is incorrect because creating a private VIF and adding routes would be applicable for establishing a direct connection between on-premises infrastructure and VPC-B using Direct Connect, but it is not suitable for the scenario of communication between EC2 instances in separate VPCs within different AWS accounts.

       Your logic is correct but security is not a requirement here - the requirements are "The connectivity should not have a single point of failure or bandwidth concerns." A VPC gateway endpoint" would form a single point of failure, so B is incorrect, (and C and D are incorrect for the same reason, they create single points of failure).

     VPC peering allows resources in different VPCs to communicate with each other as if they were within the same network. This solution would establish a direct network route between VPC-A and VPC-B, eliminating the need for a single point of failure or bandwidth concerns.

     AWS Budgets allows you to create budgets for your AWS accounts and set alerts when usage exceeds a certain threshold. By creating a budget for each account, specifying the period as monthly and the scope as EC2 instances, you can effectively track the EC2 usage for each account and be notified when a threshold is exceeded. This solution is the most cost-effective option as it does not require additional resources such as Amazon Athena or Amazon EventBridge.

     Option A and Option B suggest using Cost Explorer to create reports and send notifications. While Cost Explorer is useful for analyzing costs, it does not provide the real-time alerting capability that AWS Budgets offers.

Option D suggests using AWS Cost and Usage Reports integrated with Amazon Athena and Amazon EventBridge, which can be a more complex and potentially costlier solution compared to AWS Budgets for this specific use case. It's also more suitable for fine-grained, custom analytics rather than straightforward threshold-based alerts.

     Use AWS Budgets to create a cost budget for each account. Set the period to monthly. Set the scope to EC2 instances. Set an alert threshold for the budget. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive a notification when a threshold is exceeded.

     By creating a cost budget for each account, specifying the period as monthly and scoping it to EC2, you can track and monitor the costs associated with EC2 specifically. Set an alert threshold in the budget, which will trigger a notification when the specified threshold is exceeded. Configure an SNS to receive the notification, which can be subscribed to by the company to receive immediate alerts.

A and B are not the most cost-effective solutions as they involve using Cost Explorer to create reports, which may not provide real-time notifications when the threshold is exceeded. Additionally, A. suggests using a daily report, while B. suggests using a monthly report, which may not provide the desired level of granularity for immediate notifications.

D involves using Cost and Usage Reports with Athena and EventBridge. This solution provides more flexibility and data analysis capabilities, it is more complex and may incur additional costs for using Athena and generating hourly reports.

     C: AWS Budgets allows you to set a budget for costs and usage for your accounts and you can set alerts when the budget threshold is exceeded in real-time which meets the requirement.

Why not B: B would be the most cost-effective if the requirements didn't ask for real-time notification. You would not incur additional costs for the daily or monthly reports and the notifications. But doesn't provide real-time alerts.

     A. Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure the method to use the Lambda function. Enable IAM authentication on the API.
This option is the most operationally efficient as it allows you to use API Gateway to handle the HTTPS endpoint and also allows you to use IAM to authenticate the calls to the microservice. API Gateway also provides many additional features such as caching, throttling, and monitoring, which can be useful for a microservice.

     The question specifically asks for the solution that is most operationally efficient, not necessarily the one with the most features (which is A). 

Option B—using a Lambda function URL with AWS_IAM authentication—is indeed the most operationally efficient because:
1) Minimal Configuration: Lambda function URLs are designed to quickly create HTTPS endpoints without the need for additional AWS services like API Gateway.
2) Built-in IAM Authentication: You can easily specify AWS_IAM as the authentication type directly, fulfilling the requirement without extra setup.
3) No Extra Overhead: Unlike API Gateway, there's no need to manage complex API configurations, throttling settings, or additional API management features unless specifically required.

     B is the most operationally efficient solution. It provides the necessary functionality with minimal setup and cost, directly supports IAM authentication, and avoids the additional complexity and overhead associated with other options. This approach is particularly suitable for scenarios where the API requirements are straightforward and do not need the advanced features provided by API Gateway or CloudFront.

     I think from a decoupllng and separation of concerns A is the answer. You dont want to have a heavy reliance on the Lambda function with you have specific services for what is being required.
there is operationally efficient incorrect and operationally efficient correct.
So A is the best answer.

     I originally voted B but after reading this article, I am not sure if A is wrong or is just badly worded. 
If A actually said "Configure the [authorization] method to use the Lambda function" then it would be way more logical than B but this could be intentional. Although I think this is AWS test not IELTS so picking right answers based on small word mistakes is not the intention!

     I think this question has 2 answers as both A and B will work. However, B is more operationally efficient due to Lambda function URL and direct support for AWS_IAM as the auth type for this setup.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-auth.html#urls-auth-iam

C, D are not operationally efficient and GO is not supported on Lambda@Edge or CloudFront functions. Even if AWS start supporting it, the operational efficiency with increase because of CloudFront

     We know that the application provides "an HTTPS endpoint" but we don't even know whether it is a REST API. The question is not mentioning any other requirements besides IAM authentication, which can be handled by Lambda alone.

A would work, but would be an additional processing step (lowering operational efficiency). It would also provide benefits but none of those is asked for in the question.

C and D is wrong because Lambda@Edge does not support Go.

Enable function URL &gt;

     A.  --&gt; No since if you access via internet you are creating egress traffic.
B. --&gt;It's a good choice to have both DWH and visualization in the same region to lower the egress transfer (i.e. data going egress/out of the region) but if you access over internet you might still have  egress transfer.
C. -&gt; Valid but in this case you send out of AWS 50MB if you query the DWH instead of the visualization tool, D removes this need since puts the visualization tools in AWS with the DWH so reduces data returned out of AWS from 50MB to 500KB
D. --&gt; Correct, see explanation on answer C

     This is  question that need a careful reading of the question. Please note: in the question that the company has a DX connection but it doesn't mention the company is utilizing the DX to query the data warehouse (this indicates that the query was using internet). So my verdict would be to place the visualization tool on-prem (which it already is) and use the DX to query the data warehouse to reduce cost of (DTO) so I vote for C

       We don't want "lowest cost", we want "lowest data transfer egress cost". And "data transfer egress" cost for Direct Connect is WAY lower than for Internet. (Therefor the circuit itself is expensive, but that does exist anyway.)

     Hosting the visualization tool in the same AWS Region as the data warehouse and accessing it over a Direct Connect connection within the same Region eliminates data transfer fees and ensures low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity.

A. Hosting the visualization tool on premises and querying the data warehouse over the internet incurs data transfer costs for every query result, as well as potential latency and bandwidth limitations.

B. Hosting the visualization tool in the same AWS Region as the data warehouse but accessing it over the internet still incurs data transfer costs for each query result.

C. Hosting the visualization tool on premises and querying the data warehouse over a Direct Connect connection within the same AWS Region incurs data transfer costs for every query result and adds complexity by requiring on-premises infrastructure.

     D: Direct Connect connection at a location in the same Region will provide the lowest data transfer egress cost, improved performance, and lower complexity

Why it is not C is because the visualization tool is hosted on-premises, as it's not hosted in the same region as the data warehouse the data transfer between them would occur over the internet, thus, would incur in egress data transfer costs.

     B: Amazon RDS Multi-AZ feature automatically creates a synchronous replica in another availability zone and failover to the replica in the event of an outage. This will provide high availability and data durability across multiple AWS regions which fit the requirements. 

Though C may sound good, it in fact requires manual management and monitoring of the replication process due to the fact that Amazon RDS read replicas are asynchronous, meaning there is a delay between the primary and read replica. Therefore, there will be a need to ensure that the read replica is constantly up-to-date and someone still has to fix any read replica errors during the replication process which may cause data inconsistency. Lastly, you still have to configure additional steps to make it fail over to the read replica.

     Option C involves setting up read replicas in another region, which provides cross-region availability but may introduce additional complexity in managing replication and monitoring.

B. Migrate the PostgreSQL database to an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance with Multi-AZ:

High Availability: Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide high availability and failover support for DB instances. With Multi-AZ, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of a failure, Amazon RDS automatically fails over to the standby replica, ensuring data availability and minimal downtime. + Cross-Region Replication.

     Option C, while providing a read replica in another Region, adds complexity to the architecture and may introduce some additional operational overhead compared to Multi-AZ. Cross-Region replication involves setting up and managing replication between two separate RDS instances.

     By migrating the PostgreSQL database to an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance and creating a read replica in another AWS Region, you can achieve data availability and online access across multiple Regions. This solution requires less operational overhead compared to managing a PostgreSQL cluster on EC2 instances (Option A) or setting up manual replication using snapshots (Option D). Additionally, Amazon RDS handles the underlying infrastructure and replication setup, reducing the operational complexity for the company.

Option B, is a valid solution for achieving high availability within a single AWS Region. However, it does not meet the requirement of having the data available and online across multiple AWS Regions at all times, which is specified in the question. The Multi-AZ feature in RDS provides automatic failover within the same Region, but it does not replicate the data to multiple Regions.

     C and D just specifiy another single region. This does not translate to multiple regions.

B (Multi-AZ) means the solution will be highly available. 

The data will be available in multiple regions for both B and C but B is a better solution!

     Answer B is not right, because "RDS Multi-AZ" always span at least two Availability Zones within a single region and the question requirment RDS DB should be available in multiple regions. Therefore, C is the most suitable answer for this question.

       I would like to change my answer to "B". The question has some distractor words: "its data is available and online across multiple AWS Regions at all times". We agree that AWS is a could service available online around the world in 99 regions. So the option "B" is the most appropriate answer, since multi-AZ focuses on the avialability factor and it has the LEAST amount of operational overhead.

     B &amp; C both makes data available. However, B is less overhead. 
What I think, the question is asking for data availability across multiple regions not for a DR solution. So, RDS being accessible over public IP will do the trick for data being available across regions.

     Use a multivalue answer routing policy to help distribute DNS responses across multiple resources. For example, use multivalue answer routing when you want to associate your routing records with a Route 53 health check. For example, use multivalue answer routing when you need to return multiple values for a DNS query and route traffic to multiple IP addresses.

     The Multivalue routing policy allows Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with multiple healthy IP addresses for the same resource. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple instances are serving the same purpose and need to be load balanced or failover capable. With the Multivalue routing policy, Route 53 returns multiple IP addresses in a random order to distribute the traffic across all healthy instances.

Option A (Simple routing policy) would only return a single IP address in response to DNS queries and does not support returning multiple addresses.

Option B (Latency routing policy) is used to route traffic based on the lowest latency to the resource and does not fulfill the requirement of returning all healthy IP addresses.

Option D (Geolocation routing policy) is used to route traffic based on the geographic location of the user and does not fulfill the requirement of returning all healthy IP addresses.

Therefore, the Multivalue routing policy is the most suitable option for returning the IP addresses of all healthy EC2 instances in response to DNS queries.

"Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. You can use multivalue answer routing to create records in a private hosted zone."

Company requires that the IP addresses of "ALL" healthy EC2 instances be returned so C is the only option.

     A. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway as a virtual machine (VM) on premises at each clinic

AWS Storage Gateway is a service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's storage infrastructure. By deploying a file gateway as a virtual machine on each clinic's premises, the medical research lab can provide low-latency access to the data stored in the S3 bucket while maintaining read-only permissions for each clinic. This solution allows the clinics to access the data files directly from their on-premises file-based applications without the need for data transfer or migration.

     A. It allows the clinics to access the data files stored in the S3 bucket through a file interface. The file gateway caches frequently accessed data locally, reducing latency and providing fast access to the data.

B. It involves transferring the data files from the Amazon S3 bucket to each clinic's on-premises applications using AWS DataSync. While this enables data migration, it may not provide real-time access and may introduce additional latency.

C. It is suitable for block-level access to data rather than file-level access. It may not be the most efficient solution for file-based applications.

D. It involves using Amazon EFS, which is a scalable file storage service, to provide file-level access to the data. However, it may introduce additional complexity and latency compared to using a file gateway solution.

C: Volume Gateway provides iSCSI volumes backed by an object in AWS-managed S3, it does not provide access to S3 objects

     Amazon S3 File Gateway enables you to store file data as objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage for data lakes, backups, and Machine Learning workflows. With Amazon S3 File Gateway, each file is stored as an object in Amazon S3 with a one-to-one mapping between a file and an object.

Volume Gateway provides block storage volumes over iSCSI, backed by Amazon S3, and provides point-in-time backups as Amazon EBS snapshots. Volume Gateway integrates with AWS Backup, an automated and centralized backup service, to protect Storage Gateway volumes.

So it's A

     I think C (Volume Gateway) is correct as it has an option to have Local Storage with Asynchronous sync with S3. This would give low latency access to all local files not just cached/recent files.

     C. Move the database to Amazon Aurora with a read replica in another Availability Zone. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the EC2 instance. Configure an Application Load Balancer in two Availability Zones. Attach an Auto Scaling group that uses the AMI across two Availability Zones.

This approach will provide both high availability and scalability for the website platform. By moving the database to Amazon Aurora with a read replica in another availability zone, it will provide a failover option for the database. The use of an Application Load Balancer and an Auto Scaling group across two availability zones allows for automatic scaling of the website to meet increased user demand. Additionally, creating an AMI from the original EC2 instance allows for easy replication of the instance in case of failure.

     C is the only option via deduction logic based on the assumption the CMS database is Aurora compatible. Other solutions don't promise scaling as much as Aurora solution in option C does.

     C. Move the database to Amazon Aurora with a read replica in another Availability Zone. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the EC2 instance. Configure an Application Load Balancer in two Availability Zones. Attach an Auto Scaling group that uses the AMI across two Availability Zones.

     The question does not say if the current application is using a relational database, so how we can be sure that it can moved to RDS or aurora as answers A, B &amp; C states? In my opinion the right answer is D.

       In D, you "move the database to a separate EC2 instance" BEFORE creating the AMI for the Auto Scaling group. So you'd still have a single EC2 instance running the database, which would meet neither the availability nor the scalability requirement.

     Option A does not provide a solution for high availability or scalability. Manually launching another EC2 instance in the same AZ may not ensure high availability, as a failure in that AZ would result in downtime.

Option B improves database performance and provides a level of fault tolerance, it does not address the scalability aspect of the website platform.

Option C provides both high availability and fault tolerance. Creating an AMI allows for easy replication of the EC2 instance across AZs. Configuring an ALB in two AZs and attaching an ASG ensures scalability and load distribution across multiple instances.

Option D does not provide the high availability and scalability required by the company. Scheduled backups to S3 address data protection but do not contribute to website availability or scalability.

     C: This will allow the website platform to be highly available by using Aurora, which provides automatic failover and replication. Additionally, by creating an AMI from the original EC2 instance, the Auto Scaling group can automatically launch new instances in multiple availability zones and use the Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic across them. This way, the website will be able to handle the increased traffic, and will be less likely to go down due to a single point of failure.

     D. Reduce the maximum number of EC2 instances in the development environment's Auto Scaling group

This option will configure the development environment in the most cost-effective way as it reduces the number of instances running in the development environment and therefore reduces the cost of running the application. The development environment typically requires less resources than the production environment, and it is unlikely that the development environment will have periods of high traffic that would require a large number of instances. By reducing the maximum number of instances in the development environment's Auto Scaling group, the company can save on costs while still maintaining a functional development environment.

     A modifies only the ALB target group (= directs traffic only to one node), but does not affect the number of nodes (and the cost)
B balances load between nodes but does not affect the cost
C impacts the prod environment so that would be unable to handle its "periods of high traffic"
D makes sure that the dev environment will not scale to more than 2 instances, as does the prod environment

     So, in short, the question asks for a way to reduce cost wasted with the dev env, since it's resources are being underused. 

(A)Target group vs (B) Auto Scaling Group.

Reducing the target group won't affect the number of "nodes" (instances), cost will stay the same. To eliminate the excess of ec2 instances in the dev env, you actually need to reduce the auto scaling group.

     The application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to direct traffic to at least two Amazon EC2 instances in a single target group

You are required to keep at least two instances in each target group. A sets it to one, which would be more cost effective, but doesnt meet the requirement.

     In the question it is said minimum it should have 2 instances in Target group. So in development group we can reduce the the target group. 
In option A. It is said it will have only one instance in development group that doesn't match to our question

     B and C don't actually save any cost without impacting performance during high traffic on production.
A and D are basically same thing but A enforces a limit of one EC2 instance which is not acceptable as the question asks: "Application Load Balancer (ALB) to direct traffic to at least two Amazon EC2 instances in a single target group. The instances are in an Auto Scaling group for each environment" 
Hence D is the only valid answer.

     The most cost-effective solution is to reconfigure the target group in the development environment to have only one EC2 instance as a target. This will ensure that the development environment only uses the resources that it needs, which will save the company money.

The other solutions are not as cost-effective. Changing the ALB balancing algorithm to least outstanding requests will not reduce the number of EC2 instances that are used, and it may actually increase the amount of traffic that is directed to each instance. Reducing the size of the EC2 instances will also not reduce the number of instances that are used, and it may actually make the application slower. Reducing the maximum number of EC2 instances in the development environment's Auto Scaling group will only reduce the number of instances that are used when the traffic is high, and it will not reduce the number of instances that are used on average.

Therefore, the most cost-effective solution is to reconfigure the target group in the development environment to have only one EC2 instance as a target.

     By reconfiguring the target group in the development environment to have only one EC2 instance as a target, it reduces the number of instances handling the development environment's traffic. This ensures the minimum setup required for the development environment's functionality without incurring unnecessary costs associated with multiple instances.

This solution optimizes costs by scaling down the infrastructure specifically in the development environment where lower traffic or fewer resources might be acceptable for testing or development purposes, thus reducing unnecessary expenses related to running multiple instances.

     This option is specific to the development environment and focuses on reducing the number of instances that can be spun up during scaling events. This means cost savings because fewer instances will be used even if the scaling policies are triggered.
Given the goal to configure the development environment in the most cost-effective way, without compromising the production environment, the best option is D

       Wrong, think more. A reduces to one instance whereas: 

"The application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to direct traffic to at least two Amazon EC2 instances in a single target group"

The ALB NEEDS at least 2 instances so where is your second instance?

     Option A because it can't be option D as there should be at least two EC2 instances in Auto scaling group, and can't be reduced to one as said in option D.

So, simply reconfigure the target group in the development environment to have only one EC2 instance as a target as said in option A to reduce cost.

     I think either the question or the answers are not formulated correctly because of this document:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/load-balancer-stickiness/subnets-routing.html
A - Might be possible but it's quite impractical
B - Not needed as the setup described should work as is provided the SGs of the EC2 instances accept traffic from the ALB
C - Update the route tables for the EC2 instances' subnets to send 0.0.0.0/0 traffic through the internet gateway route - not needed as the EC2 instances would receive the traffic from the ALB ENIs. Add a rule to the EC2 instances' security groups to allow outbound traffic to 0.0.0.0/0 - the default behaviour of the SG is to allow outbound traffic only.
D -  Create public subnets in each Availability Zone. Associate the public subnets with the ALB - if it's a internet facing ALB these should already be in place. Update the route tables for the public subnets with a route to the private subnets - no need as the local prefix entry in the route tables would take care of this point

I'm 110% sure the question or answers or both are wrong. Prove me wrong! :)

     Can a EC2 in the private subnet sends traffic to the internet through ELB without using NAT gateway/instance?
if it's only about responses to requests coming through the ELB then no, you don't need NAT. If on the other hand you expect that your instances will need to initiate connections as oppose to just sending responses to the requests then yes, you will have to use NAT. The key point is that response to a request is not a new connection and will be sent to where it came from, i.e. to the ELB.

     this is a bad formulated question with gaps, but my reason tells me that if you want to connect something from a private subnet to internet you need a NAT (instance or gateway, bastion). 
Creating public subnets in each Availability Zone and associating them with the Application Load Balancer (ALB) won't resolve the problem of allowing internet traffic to reach the private EC2 instances. Public subnets are typically used when you want your EC2 instances to have direct internet access, not when you want to keep them in private subnets with indirect access through a load balancer.

     ption A (replace ALB with Network Load Balancer and add a NAT gateway) is not the most straightforward solution because it changes the load balancer type and introduces a NAT gateway, which might be unnecessary if the goal is to use an ALB for web traffic. ALBs are commonly used for internet-facing web applications.

Option B (move EC2 instances to public subnets and modify security group rules) involves placing instances in public subnets, which is generally not recommended for security reasons. Additionally, it suggests modifying security group rules for outbound traffic, which might not be the best practice to resolve the issue.

Option C (update route tables and security group rules) addresses the route table update, but it also suggests moving instances to public subnets, which is not ideal from a security perspective.

     D. is the correct solution. By creating public subnets and associating them with the ALB, inbound internet traffic can reach the ALB. The route tables for the public subnets are updated to include a route to the private subnets, allowing traffic to reach the EC2 instances in the private subnets. This setup enables secure access to the application while allowing internet traffic to reach the EC2 instances through the ALB.

     A. suggests using a different type of load balancer and configuring a NAT gateway, but it does not address the issue of internet traffic reaching the EC2 instances.

B. suggests exposing the EC2 instances to the public internet, which may pose security risks and does not address the issue of inbound internet traffic reaching the instances.

C. suggests configuring the EC2 instances to have outbound internet access, but it does not solve the problem of inbound internet traffic reaching the instances.

D. is the correct solution. By creating public subnets and associating them with the ALB, inbound internet traffic can reach the ALB. The route tables for the public subnets are updated to include a route to the private subnets, allowing traffic to reach the EC2 instances in the private subnets. This setup enables secure access to the application while allowing internet traffic to reach the EC2 instances through the ALB.

     Should be C
It would normally make sense to segregate your ALBs into public or private zones by security group and target group, but this is configuration rather than architectural placement - there is nothing preventing you from adding a rule to route specific paths or ports to a public subnet from an ALB that has until then been serving private subnets only.

       C allows the EC2 instances to be accessed directly from the Internet, which we don't want. It's the ALB (not the Internet) that can't access them. We must make sure that the ALB can be reached from the Internet and that the EC2 instances can be reached from the ALB.

     D is not quite accurate because subnets in a VPC have a local route by default, meaning that all subnets are able to communicate with each other: "Every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC. This route is added by default to all route tables". This question is poorly formulated.

Direct Impact: Enabling binlog replication is crucial for setting up read replicas, which will directly help in distributing the read load and improving read performance.
E. Enable automatic backups on the source instance by setting the backup retention period to a value other than 0:

       Also, to add, binlog replication is needed if you are replicating to a non RDS instance. This is why I think the question is badly phrased as it does not specify the location of read replica.

     To improve the read performance of a database in Amazon RDS for MySQL by adding a read replica, you should take the following actions:

    Enable binlog replication on the RDS primary node: This allows the primary node to stream its binary logs to the read replica, enabling data replication.

    A. Enable binlog replication on the RDS primary node.

    Allow long-running transactions to complete on the source DB instance: Before creating a read replica, it's advisable to let any long-running transactions complete to ensure consistency between the source and the replica.

    C. Allow long-running transactions to complete on the source DB instance.

The other options are not directly related to setting up a read replica:

       B. Choose a failover priority for the source DB instance: Failover priority is more relevant in a Multi-AZ setup where automatic failover might occur. It's not directly related to creating a read replica.

    D. Create a global table and specify the AWS Regions where the table will be available: Global tables are used for cross-region replication, but they are not directly related to setting up a read replica for improved read performance.

    E. Enable automatic backups on the source instance by setting the backup retention period to a value other than 0: While it's a good practice to have backups enabled, it is not a prerequisite for creating a read replica.

Therefore, the most appropriate actions are A and C.

     A. Enabling binlog replication is not something you need to do manually before creating a read replica. Amazon RDS for MySQL manages replication internally, and it's not necessary to enable binlog replication explicitly.

B. Choosing a failover priority is related to Multi-AZ configurations and automatic failover, but it is not specifically required when adding a read replica.

D. Creating a global table and specifying AWS Regions is related to Aurora Global Databases, which is not the same as creating a read replica for a standard RDS instance.

     **C. Long-running transactions can prevent the read replica from catching up with the source DB instance. Allowing these transactions to complete before creating the read replica can help ensure that the replica is able to stay synchronized with the source.

**E. Automatic backups must be enabled on the source DB instance for read replicas to be created. This is done by setting the backup retention period to a value other than 0.

     Bin log (binary log) is a specific terminology to MySQL, it is a write-only file that logs all history and used for purposes such as point-in-time recovery and transaction replication.

Option A is technically correct but on AWS RDS, this MySQL feature is turned on by setting backup retention period &gt; 0, that is why we must enable backup before replication can work (for MySQL, at least) =&gt; Option E is the more general answer for AWS RDS.

Option C is just a recommendation from AWS official documentation, it is there to prevent data mismatch on primary and secondaries when the long-running transactions have not been complete yet.

     Before a MySQL DB instance can serve as a replication source, make sure to enable automatic backups on the source DB instance. To do this, set the backup retention period to a value other than 0. This requirement also applies to a read replica that is the source DB instance for another read replica. Automatic backups are supported for read replicas running any version of MySQL. You can configure replication based on binary log coordinates for a MySQL DB instance

     A. enables the binary log replication feature on the RDS primary node, which is necessary for setting up a read replica.

B. determines the order in which DB instances are promoted to the primary role during a failover scenario. It is not directly related to adding a read replica to address slow reads.

C. ensures that any ongoing transactions on the source DB instance are allowed to finish before implementing the change. It helps maintain data integrity and consistency during the transition to the read replica.

D. is a feature specific to DynamoDB. It allows for multi-region replication and high availability in DynamoDB, but it is not applicable in this scenario.

E. ensures that regular backups are taken for the source DB instance. This is important for data protection and recovery purposes, as it allows for point-in-time restoration in case of any issues during or after the addition of the read replica.

     D. Route incoming requests to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Configure an EC2 Auto Scaling group based on queue size. Update the software to read from the queue.

By routing incoming requests to Amazon SQS, the company can decouple the job requests from the processing instances. This allows them to scale the number of instances based on the size of the queue, providing more resources when needed. Additionally, using an Auto Scaling group based on the queue size will automatically scale the number of instances up or down depending on the workload. Updating the software to read from the queue will allow it to process the job requests in a more efficient manner, improving the performance of the system.

     I would vote A if it was ALB targeting an EC2 auto scaling group.

     A. Creating a copy of the instance and placing all instances behind an ALB does not address the high CPU utilization issue or provide scalability based on user load.

B. Creating an S3 VPC endpoint for S3 and updating the software to reference the endpoint improves network performance but does not address the high CPU utilization or provide scalability based on user load.

C. Stopping the EC2 instances and modifying the instance type to one with a more powerful CPU and more memory may improve performance, but it does not address scalability based on user load.

D. Routing incoming requests to SQS, configuring an EC2 ASG based on queue size, and updating the software to read from the queue improves system performance and provides scalability based on user load.

Therefore, option D is the correct choice as it addresses the high CPU utilization, improves system performance, and enables scalability based on user load.

     A. involves using Storage Gateway, but it does not specifically mention support for SMB clients. It may not meet the requirement of using SMB clients to access data.

B. involves using Storage Gateway with tape gateway configuration, which is primarily used for archiving data to S3. It does not provide native support for SMB clients to access data.

C. involves manually setting up and configuring a Windows file share on an EC2 Windows instance. While it allows SMB clients to access data, it is not a fully managed solution as it requires manual setup and maintenance.

D. involves creating an FSx for Windows File Server file system, which is a fully managed Windows file system that supports SMB clients. It provides an easy-to-use shared storage solution with native SMB support.

Based on the requirements of using SMB clients and needing a fully managed solution, option D is the most suitable choice.

     A. suggests using CloudWatch as the target for VPC Flow Logs. However, it does not provide a mechanism for managing the retention of the logs for 90 days and then accessing them intermittently.

B. suggests using Kinesis as the target for VPC Flow Logs. While it can retain the logs for 90 days, it does not address the requirement for intermittent access to the logs.

C. suggests using CloudTrail as the target for VPC Flow Logs. However, CloudTrail is designed for auditing and monitoring API activity, not for capturing network traffic logs. It does not meet the requirement of capturing VPC Flow Logs.

D. suggests using S3 as the target for VPC Flow Logs and leveraging S3 Lifecycle policies to transition the logs to a cost-effective storage class after 90 days. It meets the requirement of retaining the logs for 90 days and provides the flexibility for intermittent access while optimizing storage costs.

     A is correct
You can change the log data retention setting for CloudWatch logs. By default, logs are kept indefinitely and never expire. You can adjust the retention policy for each log group, keeping the indefinite retention, or choosing a retention period between 10 years and one day.

     D. Use Amazon S3 as the target. Enable an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the logs to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 90 days.

By using Amazon S3 as the target for the VPC Flow Logs, the logs can be easily stored and accessed by the security team. Enabling an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the logs to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 90 days will automatically move the logs to a storage class that is optimized for infrequent access, reducing the storage costs for the company. The security team will still be able to access the logs as needed, even after they have been transitioned to S3 Standard-IA, but the storage cost will be optimized.

     D looks correct. This will meet the requirements of frequently accessing the logs for the first 90 days and then intermittently accessing them after that. S3 standard-IA is a storage class that is less expensive than S3 standard for infrequently accessed data, so it would be a more cost-effective option for storing the logs after the first 90 days.

     B. Create a NAT gateway, and place it in a public subnet. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.

This approach will allow the EC2 instance to access the internet and download the monthly security updates while still being located in a private subnet. By creating a NAT gateway and placing it in a public subnet, it will allow the instances in the private subnet to access the internet through the NAT gateway. And then, configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route. This will ensure that all outbound traffic is directed through the NAT gateway, allowing the EC2 instance to access the internet while still maintaining the security of the private subnet.

     B. Create a NAT gateway, and place it in a public subnet. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.

Explanation:

NAT Gateway: NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway is a managed service provided by AWS that allows EC2 instances in private subnets to access the internet while preventing inbound traffic from directly accessing them. You place the NAT gateway in a public subnet with an associated internet gateway, allowing it to send traffic to the internet.

Private Subnet Route Table: Configure the route table of the private subnet to route all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) through the NAT gateway. This allows instances in the private subnet to access the internet through the NAT gateway while maintaining their private IP addresses and security.

     A - if you "configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway" then it's no longer a private subnet
B - Correct (you place NAT GW in a public subnet and add it to the private subnet's route table)
C - NAT instance is deprecated, and it would still in a private subnet where it doesn't have Internet access
D - NAT instance is deprecated, and in that answer it is created but not even used

     yes, the nat gateway on its own does not allow connection to the internet. But the question specifies that it has been placed in a public subnet. public subnets are public because they have access to the internet via an internet gateway.

     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html
Public subnet – The subnet has a direct route to an internet gateway. Resources in a public subnet can access the public internet.
Private subnet – The subnet does not have a direct route to an internet gateway. Resources in a private subnet require a NAT device to access the public internet.

Both B and C have caveats but are both viable:
C - NAT Instance is used as a NAT device instead of NAT gateway, but it's still viable option
B - Have 2 redundant components - IGW and public subnet, and NAT gateway still would route traffic to IGW, and if VPC is a custom VPC routing has to be set up

     A NAT Gateway should have one interface in each network it is connected to. I don't understand what it means when they say it is located either in the private or in the public network. It should be in both. Therefore, B and D do not really make sense.
I choose D over B because there is a requirement to access the internet and although it is possible for the NAT to exist without an internet gateway, the later is still needed when internet access is required which is the case in this scenario.

       NAT Gateway must be in a public subnet as it needs Internet access. It can be specified in a private subnet's route table as a destination.

D doesn't make sense because you created an (outdated) NAT instance but don't use it (you point the route table to the Internet Gateway).

     A. provides direct internet access to the private subnet, which is not desired in this case as the goal is to restrict outbound internet access.

B. allows the EC2 in the private subnet to access the internet through the NAT gateway, which acts as a proxy. It provides controlled outbound internet access while maintaining the security of the private subnet.

C. is similar to using a NAT gateway, but it involves using a NAT instance. NAT instances require more manual configuration and management compared to NAT gateways, making them a less preferred option.

D. combines the use of an internet gateway and a NAT instance, which is not necessary. It introduces unnecessary complexity and adds a NAT instance that requires additional management.

Overall, option B is the most appropriate solution as it utilizes a NAT gateway placed in a public subnet to enable controlled outbound internet access for the EC2 instance in the private subnet.

NAT Gateways are preferred over NAT Instances by AWS and in general.

       Because NAT Gateways are preferred over NAT Instances by AWS and in general.

I have yet to find a situation where a NAT Instance would be more applicable than NAT Gateway which is fully managed and is overall an easier solution to implement - both in AWS questions or the real world.

     EFS provides a scalable and fully managed file storage service that can be accessed concurrently from multiple EC2. It offers built-in redundancy by storing data across multiple AZs within a region. With EFS, the client case files can be accessed by multiple application servers simultaneously, ensuring high availability and scalability as the number of files grows over time.

Option B, EBS, is a block-level storage service that is typically used for attaching to individual EC2 and does not provide concurrent access to multiple instances, making it unsuitable for this scenario.

Option C, S3 Glacier Deep Archive, is a long-term archival storage service and may not be suitable for active file access and simultaneous access from multiple application servers.

Option D, AWS Backup, is a centralized backup management service and does not provide the required simultaneous file access and redundancy features.

Therefore, the most suitable solution is Amazon EFS (option A).

     B. Create security group rules using the security group ID as the source or destination.
This way, the security team can ensure that the least privileged access is given to the application tiers by allowing only the necessary communication between the security groups. For example, the web tier security group should only allow incoming traffic from the load balancer security group and outgoing traffic to the application tier security group. This approach provides a more granular and secure way to control traffic between the different tiers of the application and also allows for easy modification of access if needed.
It's also worth noting that it's good practice to minimize the number of open ports and protocols, and use security groups as a first line of defense, in addition to network access control lists (ACLs) to control traffic between subnets.

     By using security group IDs, the ingress and egress rules can be restricted to only allow traffic from the necessary source or destination, and to deny all other traffic. This ensures that only the minimum required traffic is allowed between the application tiers.

Option A is not the best choice because using the instance ID as the source or destination would allow traffic from any instance with that ID, which may not be limited to the specific application tier.

Option C is also not the best choice because using VPC CIDR blocks would allow traffic from any IP address within the VPC, which may not be limited to the specific application tier.

Option D is not the best choice because using subnet CIDR blocks would allow traffic from any IP address within the subnet, which may not be limited to the specific application tier.

     A. would limit the traffic based on specific instances, which may not be the most suitable solution for applying the principle of least privilege between application tiers.

B. By using security group IDs in the rules, you can precisely control the traffic between application tiers, allowing only the necessary communication and adhering to the principle of least privilege.

C. would apply broad rules based on the entire VPC CIDR blocks, which may not provide the necessary level of granularity required for secure communication between specific application tiers.

D. would limit the traffic based on subnet CIDR blocks, which may not be sufficient for ensuring proper security between application tiers.

In summary, using security group IDs (Option B) is the recommended approach as it allows for precise control of traffic between application tiers, aligning with the principle of least privilege.

     D. Store the order in the database. Send a message that includes the order number to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Set the payment service to retrieve the message and process the order. Delete the message from the queue.
This approach ensures that the order creation and payment processing steps are separate and atomic. By sending the order information to an SQS FIFO queue, the payment service can process the order one at a time and in the order they were received. If the payment service is unable to process an order, it can be retried later, preventing the creation of multiple orders. The deletion of the message from the queue after it is processed will prevent the same message from being processed multiple times.
It's worth noting that FIFO queues guarantee that messages are processed in the order they are received, and prevent duplicates.

     A. is not a suitable solution for preventing the creation of multiple orders. This approach does not guarantee the sequential and reliable processing of orders.

B. is not an appropriate solution for preventing the creation of multiple orders. CloudTrail is primarily used for logging and auditing API activity, and invoking a Lambda based on the logged request does not ensure the correct order processing.

C. is not a suitable solution. SNS is a publish-subscribe messaging service, and polling it may result in delayed processing and potential order duplication.

D. is the correct solution. Using an SQS FIFO ensures that the orders are processed in a sequential and reliable manner, preventing the creation of multiple orders for the same transaction.

     B. allows multiple versions of objects in the S3 bucket to be stored. This ensures that all versions of the documents are available, even if they are accidentally overwritten or deleted.

D. adds an extra layer of protection against accidental deletion of objects in the bucket. With MFA Delete enabled, a user would need to provide an additional authentication factor to successfully delete objects from the bucket. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions and provides an extra level of security for critical documents.

A. would restrict users from modifying or uploading documents. It would not meet the requirement of allowing users to download, modify, and upload documents.

C. can control access permissions to the bucket, it does not specifically address the requirement of preventing accidental deletion or ensuring availability of all versions of the documents.

E. Encryption focuses on data protection rather than versioning and deletion prevention.

     This solution meets the requirements because it is serverless and does not affect the speed of EC2 instance launches. Amazon CloudWatch metric streams can continuously stream CloudWatch metrics to destinations such as Amazon S3. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose can capture, transform, and deliver streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics services. It can directly put the data into Amazon S3, which can then be used for near-real-time updates in a dashboard.

     You can use metric streams to continually stream CloudWatch metrics to a destination of your choice, with near-real-time delivery and low latency. Supported destinations include AWS destinations such as Amazon Simple Storage Service and several third-party service provider destinations.
Main usage scenarios for CloudWatch metric streams: Data lake— Create a metric stream and direct it to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that delivers your CloudWatch metrics to a data lake such as Amazon S3.

     B. introduces unnecessary complexity and overhead for collecting and sending the EC2 Auto Scaling status data to S3. It is not the most efficient serverless solution for this specific requirement.

C. would introduce delays in data updates, as it is not triggered in real-time. Additionally, it adds unnecessary overhead and complexity compared to using a direct data stream.

D. introduces additional dependencies and management overhead. It may also impact the speed of EC2 instance launches, which is a requirement that needs to be avoided.

Overall, option A provides a streamlined and serverless solution by leveraging CloudWatch metric streams and Kinesis Data Firehose to efficiently capture and store the EC2 Auto Scaling status data in S3 without affecting the speed of EC2 instance launches.

     Option C, using an Amazon EventBridge rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to send the EC2 Auto Scaling status data directly to Amazon S3, may not be the best choice because it may not provide real-time updates to the dashboard.

A schedule-based approach with an EventBridge rule and Lambda function may not be able to deliver the data in near real-time, as the EC2 Auto Scaling status data is generated dynamically and may not always align with the schedule set by the EventBridge rule.

Additionally, using a schedule-based approach with EventBridge and Lambda also has the potential to create latency, as there may be a delay between the time the data is generated and the time it is sent to S3.

In this scenario, using Amazon CloudWatch and Kinesis Data Firehose as described in Option A, provides a more reliable and near real-time solution.

     No, D should be correct.

"LEAST operational overhead" =&gt; Should you fully manage service like Glue instead of manually like the answer A.

       I also think it's D but remember that D requires writing ETL logic in AWS Glue (nothing in question says how complex it will be). AWS Lambda for CSV could be simple also (imagine NodeJS and millions of libraries support or Python's parsing) so both could be operationally on par to each other. Logically D makes more sense but in practice, AWS Glue rarely works with out of the box ETL and becomes a maintenance overhead in itself.

     Here A is the correct answer. The reason here is the least operational overhead.
A ==&gt; S3 - Lambda - S3
D ==&gt; S3 - Lambda - Glue - S3

Also, glue cannot convert on fly automatically, you need to write some code there. If you write the same code in lambda it will convert the same and push the file to S3

Lambda has max memory of 128 MB to 10 GB. So, it can handle it easily.

And we need to consider cost also, glue cost is more. Hope many from this forum realize these differences.

     AWS Glue can run your extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs as new data arrives. For example, you can configure AWS Glue to initiate your ETL jobs to run as soon as new data becomes available in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). 
Clearly you don't need  a lambda function to initiate the ETL job.

https://aws.amazon.com/glue/#:~:text=to%20initiate%20your-,ETL,-jobs%20to%20run

Option A requires writing code to perform the file conversion.

In the exam option D would the best answer.

     This solution meets the requirements with the least operational overhead because AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service that makes it easy to move data between data stores. AWS Glue can read .csv files from an S3 bucket and write the data into Parquet format in another S3 bucket. The AWS Lambda function can be triggered by an S3 PUT event when a new .csv file is uploaded, and it can start the AWS Glue ETL job to convert the file to Parquet format. This solution does not require managing any servers or clusters, which reduces operational overhead.

     A. introduces significant operational overhead. This approach requires managing the Lambda, handling concurrency, and ensuring proper error handling for large file sizes, which can be challenging.

B. adds unnecessary complexity and operational overhead. Managing the Spark job, handling scalability, and coordinating the Lambda invocations for each file upload can be cumbersome.

C. introduces additional complexity and may not be the most efficient solution. It involves managing Glue resources, scheduling Lambda, and querying data even when no new files are uploaded.

Option D leverages AWS Glue's ETL capabilities, allowing you to define and execute a data transformation job at scale. By invoking the ETL job using an Lambda function for each S3 PUT event, you can ensure that files are efficiently converted to Parquet format without the need for manual intervention. This approach minimizes operational overhead and provides a streamlined and scalable solution.

     A. suggests using AWS Backup, a centralized backup management service, to retain RDS backups. A backup vault is created, and a backup plan is defined with a daily schedule and a 2-year retention period for backups. RDS DB instances are assigned to this backup plan.

B. it does not address the requirement for consistent and restorable backups. Snapshots are point-in-time backups and may not provide the desired level of consistency.

C. it is not designed to provide the backup and restore functionality required for databases. It does not ensure the backups are consistent or provide an easy restore mechanism.

D. it does not address the requirement for daily backups and retention of consistent backups. It focuses more on replication and change data capture rather than backup and restore.

     The solution architect should recommend option B - Configure a backup window for the RDS DB instances for daily snapshots. Assign a snapshot retention policy of 2 years to each RDS DB instance. Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to schedule snapshot deletions.

This meets the requirements of:

Retaining daily backups for a minimum of 2 years. The daily snapshots captured within the backup window provide consistent, restorable backups on a daily basis.

Assigning a snapshot retention policy of 2 years ensures the snapshots are retained for the required period.

Using Amazon DLM allows automatically deleting snapshots older than 2 years to comply with the retention period in a cost-effective manner without manual administration.

The other option of using AWS Backup vault is not as suitable since it has limitations such as 35 day maximum retention for automated backups. Option B provides a native RDS solution capable of meeting the long term 2 year retention requirements.

       If not specified, AWS Backup Vault Lock will not enforce a maximum retention period. If specified, backup and copy jobs to this vault with lifecycle retention periods longer than the maximum retention period will fail. Recovery points already saved in the vault prior to the vault lock's creation are not affected. The longest maximum retention period you can specify is 36500 days (approximately 100 years).

     Here's why Option B is the best choice:

Backup Window: Configuring a backup window for daily snapshots ensures that consistent backups are taken at the specified time each day. This helps maintain data integrity and consistency.

Snapshot Retention Policy: Assigning a snapshot retention policy of 2 years to each RDS DB instance ensures that the backups are retained for the required duration.

Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM): Amazon DLM can be used to automate the management of EBS snapshots, including RDS snapshots. You can configure Amazon DLM to schedule snapshot deletions, making it easier to manage the retention policy without manual intervention.

Option A (AWS Backup) is primarily used for managing backups of resources that may not have built-in backup capabilities, but for Amazon RDS, it's better to use the built-in snapshot capabilities and Amazon DLM for snapshot retention.

     Why not D?

Creating tasks for ongoing replication using AWS DMS: You can create an AWS DMS task that captures ongoing changes from the source data store. You can do this capture while you are migrating your data. You can also create a task that captures ongoing changes after you complete your initial (full-load) migration to a supported target data store. This process is called ongoing replication or change data capture (CDC). AWS DMS uses this process when replicating ongoing changes from a source data store.

     D. Join the file system to the Active Directory to restrict access.

Joining the FSx for Windows File Server file system to the on-premises Active Directory will allow the company to use the existing Active Directory groups to restrict access to the file shares, folders, and files after the move to AWS. This option allows the company to continue using their existing access controls and management structure, making the transition to AWS more seamless.

     D. allows the file system to leverage the existing AD infrastructure for authentication and access control.

Option A is incorrect because mapping the AD groups to IAM groups is not applicable in this scenario. IAM is primarily used for managing access to AWS resources, while the requirement is to integrate with the on-premises AD for access control.

Option B is incorrect because assigning a tag with a Restrict tag key and a Compliance tag value does not provide the necessary integration with the on-premises AD for access control. Tags are used for organizing and categorizing resources and do not provide authentication or access control mechanisms.

Option C is incorrect because creating an IAM service-linked role linked directly to FSx for Windows File Server does not integrate with the on-premises AD. IAM roles are used within AWS for managing permissions and do not provide the necessary integration with external AD systems.

     The on-premise AD already has restrictions via group in place so D makes no sense as the groups are already linked to file system.
"The company must ensure that the on-premises Active Directory groups restrict access to the FSx for Windows File Server SMB compliance shares, folders, and files after the move to AWS."

The question is about linking the on-prem permissions to the new FSx server on AWS and this can only be done by A

       Actually neither A nor D make sense.

"A self-managed on-premises Active Directory controls access to the files and folders." This makes D sound useless and at the same time does not allow the on-prem AD to control file access on FSx.

A uses IAM roles which is irrelevant to this setup.

     Option A: Creating an Active Directory Connector and mapping groups to IAM groups is more relevant for AWS Directory Service, such as AWS Managed Microsoft AD, and not for integrating with existing on-premises Active Directory.

    Option B: Using tags is typically not used for access control purposes. Tags are metadata and are not directly involved in user authentication and authorization.

    Option C: Creating an IAM service-linked role directly linked to FSx for Windows File Server is not the standard approach for integrating with existing on-premises Active Directory.

     This allows the on-premises Active Directory to manage permissions to the FSx file shares, meeting the key requirement to use existing AD groups to control access after migrating to AWS.

Joining FSx to the AD domain allows the native file system permissions, users, and groups to be applied from Active Directory. Access is handled seamlessly via the trust relationship between FSx and AD.

The other options would not leverage the existing AD identities and groups

       The other options would not leverage the existing AD identities and groups:

A) AD Connector and IAM groups would require re-mapping AD groups to IAM, adding complexity. Native AD integration is simpler.

B) Tags and IAM groups also don't use native AD semantics.

C) Service-linked roles are not applicable for managing end user access.

So D is the correct option to meet the requirements using the native Active Directory integration built into FSx for Windows.

     Option D: Join the file system to the Active Directory to restrict access.

Joining the FSx for Windows File Server file system to the on-premises Active Directory allows the company to use the existing Active Directory groups to restrict access to the file shares, folders, and files after the move to AWS. By joining the file system to the Active Directory, the company can maintain the same access control as before the move, ensuring that the compliance team can maintain compliance with the relevant regulations and standards.

Options A and B involve creating an Active Directory Connector or assigning a tag to map the Active Directory groups to IAM groups, but these options do not allow for the use of the existing Active Directory groups to restrict access to the file shares in AWS.

Option C involves creating an IAM service-linked role linked directly to FSx for Windows File Server to restrict access, but this option does not take advantage of the existing on-premises Active Directory and its access control.

     Using a Directory Connector to connect the on-premises Active Directory to AWS is one way to enable access to AWS resources, including Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. However, joining the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system to the on-premises Active Directory is a separate step that allows you to control access to the file shares using the same Active Directory groups that are used on-premises.

For C:
IMPROVED USER EXPERIENCE
Lambda@Edge can help improve your users' experience with your websites and web applications across the world, by letting you personalize content for them without sacrificing performance.

Real-time Image Transformation
You can customize your users' experience by transforming images on the fly based on the user characteristics. For example, you can resize images based on the viewer's device type—mobile, desktop, or tablet. You can also cache the transformed images at CloudFront Edge locations to further improve performance when delivering images.

     A. Create a peering connection between the VPCs. Add a route table entry for the peering connection in both VPCs. Configure an inbound rule for the ElastiCache cluster's security group to allow inbound connection from the application's security group.

Creating a peering connection between the VPCs allows the application's EC2 instances to communicate with the ElastiCache cluster directly and efficiently. This is the most cost-effective solution as it does not involve creating additional resources such as a Transit VPC, and it does not incur additional costs for traffic passing through the Transit VPC. Additionally, it is also more secure as it allows you to configure a more restrictive security group rule to allow inbound connection from only the application's security group.

     Create a VPC peering connection between the Cache VPC and App VPC. This allows private IP connectivity between the VPCs.
Add route table entries in each VPC to route traffic destined to the other VPC via the peering connection. This enables network routing.

     Creating a peering connection between the VPCs is a cost-effective way to establish connectivity. By adding a route table entry for the peering connection in both VPCs, traffic can flow between them. Configuring an inbound rule in the ElastiCache cluster's security group allows inbound connections from the application's security group, enabling access to the ElastiCache cluster from the EC2 instances in the App VPC.

Option B suggests creating a Transit VPC, which adds unnecessary complexity and cost for this scenario.

Option C suggests configuring an inbound rule for the peering connection's security group, which is not necessary as the security group for the ElastiCache cluster should be used to control inbound connections.

Option D suggests configuring an inbound rule for the Transit VPC's security group, which is not needed in this case and adds unnecessary complexity.

Therefore, option A is the most cost-effective solution to provide the application's EC2 instances with access to the ElastiCache cluster.

     A is correct, 
1. VPC transit is used for more complex architecture and can do VPCs to VPCs connectivity. But for simple VPC 2 VPC can use peer connection.
2.To enable private IPv4 traffic between instances in peered VPCs, you must add a route to the route tables associated with the subnets for both instances. 

So base on 1, B and D are out, base on 2 C is out

     Options B and E suggest deploying the Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes on EC2 instances, which would require managing the infrastructure and add ongoing maintenance overhead, contrary to the requirement of minimizing effort.

Option C suggests using the Amazon EC2 launch type for ECS, which still requires managing EC2 instances and is not as cost-effective and scalable as using Fargate.

Therefore, the combination of deploying an Amazon ECS cluster and an ECS service with a Fargate launch type (options A and D) is the most suitable for minimizing maintenance and scaling effort without managing additional infrastructure.

     ECS allows deploying and managing containers without having to provision the underlying infrastructure. This minimizes maintenance effort.
Using Fargate launch type means ECS will handle provisioning and scaling the infrastructure automatically. This removes the management overhead for the company.
Running multiple tasks and specifying desired count ≥ 2 will provide high availability across Availability Zones.
Together, ECS plus Fargate provide a fully managed container platform. The company doesn't need to provision or manage servers.

     AWS Fargate is a technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances. With Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers.

     ALB performs health checks on the EC2 instances, so it will only route traffic to healthy instances. This avoids the timeout errors.
ALB provides load balancing across the instances, improving performance and availability.
Route 53 routes to the ALB DNS name, so you don't have to manage records for each EC2 instance.
This is a standard and robust architecture for public-facing web applications. The ALB acts as the entry point and handles health checks and scaling.

     It is not clear from the question whether the 10 EC2s are running within the same region. ALB can only direct traffic within region, while route 53 can route traffic to multiple locations, hence C and D are wrong.

     If you focus on the question, both A and D seems to be correct.

A is correct because simple routing policy for health check is doable BUT it is also wrong because we don't know how to determine the health of instance.
D is correct because " The company occasionally experiences a timeout error when attempting to browse the application" which suggest aplication is being acccessed by a browser with means it's HTTP based and ALB is better for HTTP based healthchecks.

A web application timing out is not necessarily unhealthy instance, strictly speaking. It's just bad web application running on a healthy instance! So A may not be correct also.

     Although B can work as well, but it's nor a professional choice to associate the healthcheck with 10 EC2 instances, ALB is better option here.

A is incorect:  Simple Routing Policies Can't be associated with Health Checks
C is incorrect: Cloudfront is for caching content which is irrelevant.

     A meets the requirement ("overcome these timeout errors") without any other changes.
"If you configure health checking for all the records in a group of records that have the same name, the same type (such as A or AAAA), and the same routing policy (such as weighted or failover), Route 53 responds to DNS queries by choosing a healthy record and returning the applicable value from that record.

       "You can use Route 53 health checking to configure active-active and active-passive failover configurations. You configure active-active failover using any routing policy (or combination of routing policies) other than failover. ... Use this failover configuration when you want all of your resources to be available the majority of the time. When a resource becomes unavailable, Route 53 can detect that it's unhealthy and stop including it when responding to queries.

         In active-active failover, all the records that have the same name, the same type (such as A or AAAA), and the same routing policy (such as weighted or latency) are active unless Route 53 considers them unhealthy.

           B - No, "you configure active-active failover using any routing policy (or combination of routing policies) OTHER THAN FAILOVER". With B, all traffic would go one primary instance unless it is unhealthy.

C - Not sure how to configure multiple EC2 instances as the origin without an LB. Even if that would be possible it would introduce more changes and complexity, which is not asked for.

D - Would work if all EC2 instances are in the same region, which we don't know. But it would also incur additional cost and potentially have other effects.

     B is wrong.
The DNS cache in clients could drive to timeouts. With ALB this issue won't happen since the DNS register will be the same and ALB will take care of unhealty nodes.

     D. **Application Load Balancer (ALB) with Health Checks, Routed via Route 53**:
   - Creating an ALB in front of the EC2 instances and configuring health checks on the ALB will ensure that only healthy instances receive traffic. Route 53 can then direct traffic to the ALB, which in turn, routes traffic to healthy instances based on the health check results.

Among the provided options, the one that directly addresses the issue of routing traffic only to healthy instances is:

**D. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with a health check in front of the EC2 instances. Route to the ALB from Route 53.**

     i was looking at A, but indeed D is the best option, because the usually the TTL of the records is at least 60 seconds (nobody sets lower unless testing something ,because there is a charge per number of unique requests. ALB health check can be set as low as desired, which helps exclude the problematic ec2 faster than the DNS TTL expires

     By creating an ALB and configuring health checks, the architect ensures that only healthy instances receive traffic. The ALB periodically checks the health of the EC2 instances based on the configured health check settings.

Routing traffic to the ALB from Route 53 ensures that DNS queries return the IP address of the ALB instead of individual instances. This allows the ALB to distribute traffic only to healthy instances, avoiding timeouts caused by unhealthy instances.

A &amp; B: While associating health checks with each record can help identify unhealthy instances, it does not provide automatic load balancing and distribution of traffic to healthy instances.

C: While CloudFront can improve performance and availability, it is primarily a CDN and may not directly address the issue of load balancing and distributing traffic to healthy instances.

Therefore, option D is the most appropriate solution to overcome the timeout errors by implementing an ALB with health checks and routing traffic through Route 53.

     C. Configure a public Application Load Balancer (ALB) with multiple redundant Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. Configure Amazon CloudFront to deliver HTTPS content using the public ALB as the origin.

This solution meets the requirements for a highly available application with web, application, and database tiers, as well as providing edge-based content delivery. Additionally, it maximizes security by having the ALB in a private subnet, which limits direct access to the web servers, while still being able to serve traffic over the Internet via the public ALB. This will ensure that the web servers are not exposed to the public Internet, which reduces the attack surface and provides a secure way to access the application.

Here's the reasoning:

    Public ALB in Private Subnets: Placing the ALB in private subnets enhances security by preventing direct access from the internet. The ALB in private subnets can communicate with the application instances in the same private subnets.

    CloudFront with ALB as Origin: Configuring CloudFront to deliver HTTPS content using the public ALB as the origin allows for content to be cached and distributed globally, reducing latency for end users.

     A. Configure an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Add a listener for the port that the application listens on, and attach it to a Regional endpoint in each Region. Add the ALB as the endpoint.

AWS Global Accelerator directs traffic to the optimal healthy endpoint based on health checks, it can also route traffic to the closest healthy endpoint based on geographic location of the client. By configuring an accelerator and attaching it to a Regional endpoint in each Region, and adding the ALB as the endpoint, the solution will redirect traffic to healthy endpoints, improving the user experience by reducing latency and ensuring that the application is running optimally. This solution will ensure that traffic is directed to the closest healthy endpoint and will help to improve the overall user experience.

     B. While CloudFront can help with caching and content delivery, it does not provide the mechanism to monitor the health of the application or perform traffic redirection based on health checks.

C. This configuration is suitable for static content delivery but does not address the health monitoring and traffic redirection requirements of the application.

D. While this can enhance performance, it does not monitor the health of the application or redirect traffic based on health checks.

Therefore, option A is the most suitable solution as it leverages AWS Global Accelerator to monitor application health, route traffic to healthy endpoints, and optimize the user experience while addressing latency concerns.

     A. When you have an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer that includes multiple target groups, Global Accelerator considers the load balancer endpoint to be healthy only if each target group behind the load balancer has at least one healthy target. If any single target group for the load balancer has only unhealthy targets, Global Accelerator considers the endpoint to be unhealthy.

This solution will meet the requirements with the least operational overhead as it uses Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, which is a fully managed service that can automatically handle the data collection, data transformation, encryption, and data storage in near-real time. Kinesis Data Firehose can automatically store the data in Amazon S3 in Apache Parquet format for further processing. Additionally, it allows you to create an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application to analyze the data in near real-time, with no need to manage any infrastructure or invoke any Lambda function. This way you can process a large amount of data with the least operational overhead.

     A. requires invoking an Lambda to send the data to the analytics application. This introduces additional operational overhead and complexity.

B. While EMR is a powerful tool for big data processing, it requires more operational management and configuration compared to Kinesis Data Analytics.

C. introduces unnecessary complexity by involving EMR for data analysis when Kinesis Data Analytics can perform the analysis in a more streamlined and automated manner.

Therefore, option D is the most suitable solution as it leverages Kinesis Data Firehose for data ingestion, stores the data in S3, and utilizes Kinesis Data Analytics for near-real-time analysis, providing a low operational overhead solution for data usage analysis and encryption.

     D. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to store the data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application to analyze the data.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose can automatically encrypt and store the data in Amazon S3 in Apache Parquet format for further processing, which reduces the operational overhead. It also allows for near-real-time data analysis using Kinesis Data Analytics, which is a fully managed service that makes it easy to analyze streaming data using SQL. This solution eliminates the need for setting up and maintaining an EMR cluster, which would require more operational overhead.

       ElastiCache stores data in memory, which means it may not always have the most up-to-date information. This might be acceptable for certain use cases where slightly stale data is acceptable, but for applications like gaming scores, real-time accuracy is often crucial.

Because the data in the cache is updated every time it's written to the database, the data in the cache is always current and updated whenever data is written to the database.” https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/Strategies.html#Strategies.WriteThrough

     A. Use Amazon ElastiCache in front of the database.

Explanation:

Amazon ElastiCache is a managed caching service that can be placed in front of the database to cache frequently accessed data. By caching the most common queries, it can significantly reduce the load on the database, leading to faster response times and an improved user experience.
This solution minimizes changes to the existing architecture because it doesn't require modifications to the application's core logic or database schema. Instead, it optimizes performance by reducing the need for repetitive database reads.
ElastiCache supports both Redis and Memcached, which are widely used for caching in web applications.

     A

Caching frequently accessed data: ElastiCache can be used to reduce the load on your database by caching frequently accessed data. This can improve application performance and reduce the number of read queries to your database.

Real-time applications: If your application requires real-time data processing, ElastiCache can help. Since it provides sub-millisecond response times, it can be used to power applications like gaming leaderboards, chat applications, and real-time analytics.

     B - "Use RDS Proxy between the application and the database."
B because it improves the user experience while minimizing the changes.
If A is used, you have to modify your application to get the data from the cache first, if it is not there, then get from db; and also to invalidate the cache if there is a db update.

     RDS Proxy: It helps applications improve scalability and performance by managing database connections and pooling, which can significantly reduce the load on the database. By using RDS Proxy, you can offload connection management tasks from your application and optimize database access, thereby improving read performance without making significant changes to the application's architecture.

Minimizing Changes: Implementing RDS Proxy does not require architectural changes to the application. It works as a proxy layer between the application and the RDS database, so the application code remains unchanged. This minimizes the effort and risk associated with making modifications to the application.

     A. Use Amazon ElastiCache in front of the database:
Caching frequently accessed data in ElastiCache can help reduce the load on the database and improve read performance.
However, it's essential to note that while ElastiCache can significantly enhance read performance by serving frequently accessed data from memory, it might not entirely eliminate long delays and interruptions if the root cause is related to the database itself or if the caching strategy is not effectively implemented.

B. Use RDS Proxy between the application and the database:
Helps improve database connection management, reducing the number of open connections to the database and enhancing overall performance.
RDS Proxy handles connection pooling, which means it can efficiently manage and reuse database connections, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for each query.
It supports features like read/write splitting, which directs read queries to read replicas, further distributing the load.

     ". A solutions architect needs to solve the problem with minimal changes to the existing web application."
ABD all require major changes to the application.
A: DynamoDB is NoSQL so big change
B: Elasticache is a caching layer which require code change normally significant code change
D: Redshift is analytics so not a solution

     . While DynamoDB is a scalable NoSQL database, it requires changes to the application's data model and query patterns.

B. ElastiCache is an in-memory data store that can improve query performance, but it is primarily used for caching rather than running complex queries.

D. Redshift is a powerful data warehousing solution, but migrating the data and adapting the queries to Redshift's columnar architecture would require significant changes to the application and query logic.

Therefore, option C is the most appropriate recommendation as it leverages read replicas in RDS to offload read-only query traffic from the primary database, allowing the business analysts to run their queries without impacting the performance of the web application. It provides a scalable and efficient solution with minimal changes to the existing web application.

     C. Create a read replica of the primary database and have the business analysts run their queries.

Creating a read replica of the primary RDS database will offload the read-only SQL queries from the primary database, which will help to improve the performance of the web application. Read replicas are exact copies of the primary database that can be used to handle read-only traffic, which will reduce the load on the primary database and improve the performance of the web application. This solution can be implemented with minimal changes to the existing web application, as the business analysts can continue to run their queries on the read replica without modifying the code.

     I think the many votes for A are caused by misunderstanding the wording as
"Ensure that
the data is encrypted at rest before the data is uploaded"

But that doesn't make sense, it means

"Ensure that the data is encrypted at rest
before the data is uploaded"

So, before you allow people to upload data, make sure that it gets encrypted.

     Configuring scheduled scaling actions allows the Auto Scaling group to scale up to the desired capacity at a scheduled time (1 AM in this case) when the batch jobs start. This ensures the desired compute capacity is reached immediately.

The Auto Scaling group can then scale down based on metrics after the batch jobs complete.

     C. Configure scheduled scaling to scale up to the desired compute level.

By configuring scheduled scaling, the solutions architect can set the Auto Scaling group to automatically scale up to the desired compute level at a specific time (1AM) when the batch job starts and then automatically scale down after the job is complete. This will allow the desired EC2 capacity to be reached quickly and also help in reducing the cost.

     Configuring caching based on the language of the viewer
If you want CloudFront to cache different versions of your objects based on the language specified in the request, configure CloudFront to forward the Accept-Language header to your origin.

If you want CloudFront to cache different versions of your objects based on the language specified in the request, configure CloudFront to forward the Accept-Language header to your origin.
If you want CloudFront to cache different versions of your objects based on the country that the request came from, configure CloudFront to forward the CloudFront-Viewer-Country header to your origin. CloudFront automatically converts the IP address that the request came from into a two-letter country code. For an easy-to-use list of country codes, sortable by code and by country name, see the Wikipedia entry ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.

     By caching content based on the Accept-Language request header, CloudFront can serve the appropriate version of the website to users based on their language preferences. This solution allows the company to improve the website's performance for users around the world without having to recreate the existing architecture in multiple Regions.

     CloudFront allows you to customize cache behavior based on various request headers. By setting the cache behavior to cache based on the Accept-Language request header, CloudFront can store and serve language-specific versions of the website content, reducing the need to repeatedly fetch the content from the ALB for users with the same language preference.

     Note: The difference between pilot light and warm standby can sometimes be difficult to understand. Both include an environment in your DR Region with copies of your primary Region assets. The distinction is that pilot light cannot process requests without additional action taken first, whereas warm standby can handle traffic (at reduced capacity levels) immediately. The pilot light approach requires you to “turn on” servers, possibly deploy additional (non-core) infrastructure, and scale up, whereas warm standby only requires you to scale up (everything is already deployed and running). Use your RTO and RPO needs to help you choose between these approaches.

     Option A is incorrect because while Amazon Aurora global database is a good solution for disaster recovery, pilot light deployment provides only a minimalistic setup and would require manual intervention to make the DR Region fully operational, which increases the recovery time.

Option B is a better choice than Option A as it provides a warm standby deployment, which is an automated and more scalable setup than pilot light deployment. In this setup, the database is replicated to the DR Region, and the standby instance can be brought up quickly in case of a disaster.

Option C is incorrect because Multi-AZ DB instances provide high availability, not disaster recovery.

Option D is a good choice for high availability, but it does not meet the requirement for DR in a different region with the least possible latency.

     "Different Region" rules out C and D ("Multi-AZ" is within a region)

     The warm standby approach involves ensuring that there is a scaled down, but fully functional, copy of your production environment in another Region. 
With the pilot light approach, you replicate your data from one Region to another and provision a copy of your core workload infrastructure. Resources required to support data replication and backup, such as databases and object storage, are always on. Other elements, such as application servers, are loaded with application code and configurations, but are "switched off".

     In a Pilot Light scenario, only an EC2 Instance and a DB may be running. In Warm Standby, however, everything is running — in a much smaller capacity. This means the load balancer, gateways, databases, all subnets, and everything else are ready to go on a moment's notice.

with reference to below statement Option B is a better choice than Option A. 
"The remaining infrastructure in the DR Region needs to run at reduced capacity and must be able to scale up if necessary".

       No, my friend. The question asks for deployment in another Region. Hence, it cannot be C or D. 
The answer is B because is Global (different regions) and Ward Standby has faster RTO than Pilot Light.

     Guys, sorry but I don't really have time to deepdive as my exam is soon. Based on chatGPT and my previous study the answer should be B
"Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances. Copy the AMIs to a secondary AWS Region. Automate infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region by using AWS CloudFormation," would likely be the most suitable solution for the given requirements.

This option allows for the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances, which can then be copied to a secondary AWS region to provide disaster recovery capabilities. The infrastructure deployment in the secondary region can be automated using AWS CloudFormation, which can help to reduce the amount of time and resources needed for deployment and management.

     Option B would be the most operationally efficient solution for implementing a DR solution for the application, meeting the requirement of an RTO of less than 4 hours and using the fewest possible AWS resources during normal operations.

By creating Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances and copying them to a secondary AWS Region, the company can ensure that they have a reliable backup in the event of a disaster. By using AWS CloudFormation to automate infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region, the company can minimize the amount of time and effort required to set up the DR solution.

     Option A: Add complexity and management overhead.

Option B: Creating AMIs for backup and using AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region is a more streamlined and automated approach. CloudFormation allows you to define and provision resources in a declarative manner, making it easier to maintain and update your infrastructure. This solution is more operationally efficient compared to Option A.

Option C: could be expensive and not fully aligned with the requirement of using the fewest possible AWS resources during normal operations.

Option D: might not be sufficient for meeting the DR requirements, as Availability Zones are still within the same AWS Region and might be subject to the same regional-level failures.

     At first, I thought the answer is A. But it is C.

It seems that there is no information in the question about CPU or Memory usage. 
So, we might think the answer is A. why? because what we need is to have the required (desired) number of instances. It already has scheduled scaling that works well in this scenario. Scale down after working hours and scale up in working hours. So, it just needs to adjust the desired number to start from 20 instances.

But here is the point it shows A is WRONG!!!
If it started with desired 20 instances, it will keep it for the whole day. What if the load is reduced? We do not need to keep the 20 instances always. That 20 is the MAXIMUM number we need, no the DESIRE number. So it is against COST that is the main objective of this question.

So, the answer is C

       If it stars with 20 instances it will not keep it all day. It will scale down based on demand. The scheduled action in Option A simply ensures that there are enough instances running to handle the increased traffic when the day begins, while still allowing the Auto Scaling group to scale up or down based on demand during the rest of the day. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/scale-your-group.html

         From what I can tell, you must specify an end time, or else it will run indefinitly. So I think A would be right, if they specified an end time. Otherwise C is more cost effective

     C. Implement a target tracking action triggered at a lower CPU threshold, and decrease the cooldown period.

Here's the reasoning:

    Target Tracking Scaling Policy: With a target tracking scaling policy, you can set a target value for a specific metric, such as CPU utilization. The Auto Scaling group then adjusts the capacity to maintain that target.

    Lower CPU Threshold: By triggering the target tracking action at a lower CPU threshold, the Auto Scaling group can proactively add instances when the workload increases, helping to address the slowness at the beginning of the day.

    Decrease Cooldown Period: Reducing the cooldown period allows the Auto Scaling group to scale in and out more rapidly, making adjustments quicker in response to changing demand.

     Question is about cost effectiveness hence Use target tracking scaling policies to maintain a specific metric, such as CPU utilization or request count per target. This allows the Auto Scaling group to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on real-time demand. We do not need to have 20 instances up and running during start of the day.

     Not C because:  target tracking scaling attempts to maintain a target metric (like average CPU utilization). While more responsive, it would still react to increased load rather than pre-scaling. The initial slow period would persist as the scaling reacts to the increased demand rather than anticipating it.

     A is not cost effective, it would set the number of instances to maximum even before the first employee arrives. 
D is not cost effective, it would cause the permanent use of 20 instances

B could almost work, but if you configure small steps then it scales too slowly in the morning; if you configure big steps (like "add 8 instances at a time") it would scale in the morning but not be cost-efficient during the day.

C would address the requirement, it would scale to meet a certain CPU utilization. Decreasing the cooldown period (which is not possible for the scaling policy itself but for the auto-scaling group) would help 'keeping costs to a minimum'.

     A. since only a boot storm issue at 9am and settle down in mid morning, 20 instance is enough to support the workload
NOT C. Reduce threshold to trigger (lets say 50% from 80% utilization) and lower cool down period, will still take time to ramp up to max 20 instance.

     To keep costs to a minimum target tracking is the best option.
For example the scaling metric is the average CPU utilization of the EC2 auto scaling instances, and their average during the day should always be 80%. When CloudWatch detects that the average CPU utilization is beyond 80% at start of day, it will trigger the target tracking policy to scale out the auto scaling group to meet this target utilization. Once everything is settled and the average CPU utilization has gone below 80% at night, another scale in action will kick in and reduce the number of auto scaling instances in the auto scaling group.

     Scaling Out: In the morning when you schedule the AWS EC2 scaling to have a minimum and maximum of 20 instances, if the load on your application increases beyond the current number of instances, AWS Auto Scaling will automatically launch new instances to meet the demand up to the maximum of 20 instances.

Scaling In: As the load on your application decreases in the afternoon or night, AWS Auto Scaling will continuously monitor the health and load of your instances. If the instances are underutilized and can be terminated without affecting your application's performance, AWS Auto Scaling will automatically scale in by terminating excess instances, 

Why not D? If you specify the min instance, AWS will always keep the minimum number of instances (20 in this case) running.

     A) Configure storage Auto Scaling on the RDS for Oracle instance.
= Makes sense. With RDS Storage Auto Scaling, you simply set your desired maximum storage limit, and Auto Scaling takes care of the rest.

B) Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora to use Auto Scaling storage.
= Scenario specifies application's data layer uses Oracle-specific PL/SQL functions. This rules out migration to Aurora.

C) Configure an alarm on the RDS for Oracle instance for low free storage space.
= You could do this but what does it fix? Nothing. The CW notification isn't going to trigger anything.

D) Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the average CPU as the scaling metric.
= Makes sense. The CPU utilization is the precursor to the storage outage. When the ec2 instances are overloaded, the RDS instance storage hits its limits, too.

     To ensure the system can automatically scale for the increased traffic, you can take the following steps:
A. Configure storage Auto Scaling on the RDS for Oracle instance.

By enabling storage Auto Scaling on the RDS instance, you ensure that additional storage is provisioned automatically when the existing storage reaches capacity. This helps prevent the RDS instance from running out of storage due to increased traffic and data growth.

C. Configure an alarm on the RDS for Oracle instance for low free storage space.

Setting up an alarm for low free storage space on the RDS instance allows you to receive notifications when the storage capacity is approaching its limits. This proactive monitoring helps you take necessary actions, such as adding more storage or scaling resources, before it affects the application's performance.

    This option allows the RDS instance to automatically scale its storage based on the actual storage usage, ensuring that you don't run out of storage.

D. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the average CPU as the scaling metric.

    By using CPU utilization as a scaling metric, the Auto Scaling group can dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on the application's demand. This helps in handling increased traffic and preventing overload on existing instances.

       Option B (Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora): While Amazon Aurora provides benefits such as auto-scaling storage and high performance, it involves migrating from Oracle to Aurora, which might require application changes and data migration efforts.

    Option C (Configure an alarm on the RDS for Oracle instance for low free storage space): While it's good to have an alarm for low storage space, configuring storage Auto Scaling (Option A) is a more proactive solution that automatically adjusts storage before reaching a critical point.

    Option E (Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the average free memory as the scaling metric): While monitoring memory is important for application performance, CPU utilization is often a more direct and responsive metric for auto-scaling in many scenarios.

     Option B (Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora) may be a good long-term solution, but it involves database migration, which can be complex and time-consuming. For immediate scalability and to address the storage issue, configuring storage Auto Scaling on the existing RDS instance is a more immediate and straightforward solution.

Option C (Configure an alarm on the RDS for Oracle instance for low free storage space) is useful for monitoring, but it doesn't proactively address the storage issue by automatically expanding storage as needed.

Option E (Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the average free memory as the scaling metric) is less common as a scaling metric for EC2 instances compared to CPU utilization. While memory can be an important factor for application performance, CPU utilization is typically a more commonly used metric for scaling decisions. It also doesn't directly address the RDS storage issue.

     These options will allow the system to scale both the compute tier (EC2 instances) and the data tier (RDS storage) automatically as traffic increases:
A. Storage Auto Scaling will allow the RDS for Oracle instance to automatically increase its allocated storage when free storage space gets low. This ensures the database does not run out of capacity and can continue serving data to the application.
D. Configuring the EC2 Auto Scaling group to scale based on average CPU utilization will allow it to launch additional instances automatically as traffic causes higher CPU levels across the instances. This scales the compute tier to handle increased demand.

B. Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora to use Auto Scaling Storage. --- Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and repaired automatically.
D. Configurate the Auto Scaling group to sue the average CPU as the scaling metric. -- Good choice.

I believe either A &amp; C or B &amp; D options will work.

     D. Use Amazon S3 for storing the video content. Move the files temporarily over to an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume attached to the server for processing.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is highly durable, scalable, and cost-effective for storing large volumes of data, such as video content. It offers lower storage costs compared to Amazon EFS and is suitable for storing large files like video content.

For processing the video content, you can temporarily move the files from Amazon S3 to an Amazon EBS volume attached to the EC2 instances. This approach allows you to leverage the high-performance storage of Amazon EBS for processing, while still benefiting from the cost-effectiveness of Amazon S3 for long-term storage. Once processing is complete, you can remove the temporary files from the EBS volume and store the final results back in S3.

     Answer is closer to the following principle and D is near impossible to implement:
"Amazon S3 File Gateway – Amazon S3 File Gateway supports a file interface into Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and combines a service and a virtual software appliance. By using this combination, you can store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB). You deploy the gateway into your on-premises environment as a virtual machine (VM) running on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, or Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), or as a hardware appliance that you order from your preferred reseller. You can also deploy the Storage Gateway VM in VMware Cloud on AWS, or as an AMI in Amazon EC2. The gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files or file share mount points. With a S3 File Gateway, you can do the following"

     I was initially going for D but EBS part makes no sense as it is not possible. Closest explanation of A is in this article:
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/mounting-amazon-s3-to-an-amazon-ec2-instance-using-a-private-connection-to-s3-file-gateway/ 

A is missing a lot of key steps but D is just impossible. Maybe it's just the wording?

     AWS Storage Gateway S3 file gateway can be setup on EC2 ( https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/file-gateway-ec2 ). It use local disks/EBS for caching data.
D: Can be used too, using attached EBS volume to each EC2 instance to process files. If require single EBS volume to be attached to multiple EC2, then it is possible too if they are in the same Availability Zone -&gt; https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html.
 For me A and D both are possible, but expect AWS would like to select Storage GW

     A would work, "Storage Gateway for files" can provide access to S3 (cheap) via NFS (what the clients are using now). It has some additional cost in addition to the S3 charges, but would still be way cheaper than EFS.

B would work for a single server, but as it provides a volume via iSCSI, it could be mounted only to a single server - does not meet the 'multiple instances can access' requirement.

C and D do not meet the 'multiple instances can access' requirement because EBS can't be easily attached to all servers at the same time.

     Storage gateway is intended for on-premises applications to access cloud storage, so A, B is out. The question explicitly states that the files are uploaded and stored in EFS, not S3, so D is not correct. The answer is C. The EFS storage costs 10 times more than EBS, so moving files to EBS after processing is the solution.

       But how do you attach "an EBS volume" to all the servers, and how will you use the files on it then to serve customers? 

A doesn't say "store content ON the gateway", it says "use AWS Storage Gateway for files" (which is the product) "to store the video content" [on S3]. And to be exact, Storage Gateway is not "to transfer to the cloud" but to provide access to S3 storage via SMB or NFS.

     Amazon S3 provides low-cost object storage for storing large amounts of unstructured data like videos. The videos can be stored in S3 durably and reliably.

For processing, the video files can be temporarily copied from S3 to an EBS volume attached to the EC2 instance. EBS provides low latency block storage for high performance video processing.

Once processing is complete, the output can be stored back in S3.

     The question doesn't give enough information. Well, quite a few AWS exam questions don't provide enough info.
Ideally, A could be the best answer if it mentions S3 as the backend of storage gateway. Because if it doesn't mention S3 as the backend, that implies either Storage gateway as the storage(which is impossible) or continue using EFS(also impossible).
D is not ideal, because it will introduce video download cost for downloading files from S3 to EBS temporary storage. But it is the best option we have.

         We are ditching EFS in favor of S3. So there is no longer simultaneous access happening. Whoever needs the file, downloads it from S3, process it on their EC2 instance and save it back to S3.

     A more cost-effective storage solution for this scenario would be Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers high scalability, durability, and availability at a lower cost compared to Amazon EFS. By using Amazon S3, you only pay for the storage you use, and it is typically more cost-efficient for scenarios where data is accessed less frequently, such as video storage for processing.

     The result should be A.

Amazon storage gateway has 4 types, S3 File Gateway, FSx file gateway, Type Gateway and Volume Gateway.

If not specific reference file gateway should be default as S3 gateway, which sent file over to S3 the most cost effective storage in AWS.

Why not D, the reason is last sentence, there are multiple EC2 servers for processing the video and EBS can only attach to 1 EC2 instance at a time, so if you use EBS, which mean for each EC2 instance you will have 1 EBS. This rule out D.

B meets the need to store hierarchical employee data in DynamoDB for low latency queries at high traffic. DynamoDB can handle the access patterns for hierarchical data. Exporting to S3 monthly provides an audit trail.

E sets up Macie to analyze sensitive data and integrate with EventBridge to trigger monthly SNS notifications when financial data is present.

     , the combination of DynamoDB for fast data queries, S3 for durable storage and backups, Macie for sensitive data monitoring, and EventBridge + SNS for email notifications satisfies all needs: fast query response, sensitive data protection, and monthly alerts. The solutions architect should implement DynamoDB with export to S3, and configure Macie with integration to send SNS email notifications.

       Generally, for building a hierarchical relationship model, a graph database such as Amazon Neptune is a better choice. In some cases, however, DynamoDB is a better choice for hierarchical data modeling because of its flexibility, security, performance, and scale.

       1. Low latency - DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with single-digit millisecond latency. Redshift is a data warehouse solution optimized for complex analytical queries, so query latency would typically be higher. Since the requirements specify minimum latency for high-traffic queries, DynamoDB is better suited.
2. Scalability - DynamoDB is highly scalable, able to handle very high read and write throughput with no downtime. Redshift also scales, but may experience some downtime during rescale operations. For a high-traffic application, DynamoDB's scalability and availability are better matched.

       3. Hierarchical data - DynamoDB supports hierarchical (nested) data structures well in a NoSQL data model. Defining hierarchical employee data may be more complex in Redshift's columnar SQL data warehouse structure. DynamoDB is built around flexible data schemas that can represent complex relationships.
4. Data export - Both DynamoDB and Redshift allow exporting data to S3, so that requirement could be met with either service. However, overall DynamoDB is the better fit based on the points above regarding latency, scalability, and support for hierarchical data.

Using DynamoDB with AWS Backup, you can copy your on-demand backups across AWS accounts and Regions, add cost allocation tags to on-demand backups, and transition on-demand backups to cold storage for lower costs. To use these advanced features, you must opt in to AWS Backup.

     This solution satisfies the requirements in the following ways:
• AWS Backup will automatically take full backups of the DynamoDB table on the schedule defined in the backup plan (the first of each month).
• The lifecycle policy can transition backups to cold storage after 6 months, meeting that requirement.
• Setting a 7-year retention period in the backup plan will ensure each backup is retained for 7 years as required.
• AWS Backup manages the backup jobs and lifecycle policies, requiring no custom scripting or management.

Athena is used to analyze data stored in S3 and it is commonly used with QuickSight, thus B is the answer

     OptionB: Amazon Athena allows you to run standard SQL queries directly on the data stored in the S3 bucket.
Amazon QuickSight is a business intelligence (BI) service that allows you to create interactive and visual dashboards to analyze data. You can connect Amazon QuickSight to Amazon Athena to visualize the results of your SQL queries from the CloudFront logs.

     Using Athena to query the CloudFront logs in the S3 bucket and QuickSight to visualize the results is the best solution because it is cost-effective, scalable, and requires no infrastructure setup. It also provides a robust solution that enables the company to perform advanced analysis and build interactive visualizations without the need for a dedicated team of developers.

     A:
By using Multi-AZ deployment, the company can achieve an RPO of less than 1 second because the standby instance is always in sync with the primary instance, ensuring that data changes are continuously replicated.

     Read Replicas:
Read Replicas are asynchronous and support read scalability.
It is uese to improve performance.
Read Replicas can be in the same region or in a different region for disaster recovery purposes, but this involves manual intervention,
which means Read Replicas do not provide automatic failover and requires DNS updates and application changes

Multi-AZ:
Multi-AZ maintains a synchronous standby replica of the primary instance in a different Availability Zone within the same region.
Multi-AZ deployments provide high availability and automatic failover. 

Option A is better choice with respect to below statement,
"the company sets a standard that requires a recovery point objective (RPO) of less than 1 second for all its production databases."

     C. Configure the DB instance in one Availability Zone, and create multiple read replicas in a separate Availability Zone.
Here's why:
Read Replicas: By configuring read replicas in a separate Availability Zone, you can leverage asynchronous replication to replicate data from the primary DB instance to the read replicas with minimal latency. This setup allows for near real-time data replication and can help achieve a low RPO.

In contrast, Multi-AZ deployments (Option A) provide high availability by maintaining a standby replica but may not guarantee an RPO of less than 1 second due to synchronous replication and failover considerations. Options B and D are not directly related to achieving a low RPO for the databases.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <p>
     <strong>
      Comment:
     </strong>
     I'm unsure with A, because the term RPO is not only applied to datacenter outages. Say, an application error corrupts the database, or an administrator accidentally overwrites all records. With answer A, Multi-AZ, these changes would be instantly copied to the replica.

Only reason why A might still be correct is that the other answers don't make much more sense.

B has nothing to do with RPO at all
C could lose more than 1 second since read replicas are asynchronous
D could be part of a solution but the CDC ask alone won't help

     Used for DR. Every single change is replicated in a standby AZ. If we lose the main AZ, (uses the same DNS name) standby becomes automatic failover and the new main DB.

     configure the security group for the EC2 instances to only allow traffic that comes from the security group for the ALB. This ensures that only the traffic originating from the ALB is allowed access to the EC2 instances in the private subnet, while denying any other traffic from other sources. The other options do not provide a suitable solution to meet the stated requirements.

     This solution satisfies the needs in the following ways:
• Amazon EC2 provides a seamless migration path for the existing server-based applications without code changes. The simulation app can run on Linux EC2 instances and the visualization app on Windows EC2 instances.
• Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP provides highly performant file storage that is accessible via both NFS and SMB. This allows the simulation app to write to NFS shares as currently designed, and the visualization app to access the same data via SMB.
• FSx for NetApp ONTAP ensures the data is synchronized and up to date across the file systems. This addresses the data duplication issues of the current setup. 
• Resources can be scaled efficiently since EC2 and FSx provide scalable compute and storage on demand.

       The other options would require more significant changes:
A. Migrating to Lambda would require re-architecting both applications and not meet the requirement to avoid code changes. S3 does not provide file system access. 
B. While ECS could run the apps without code changes, FSx File Gateway only provides S3 or EFS storage, neither of which offer both NFS and SMB access. Data exchange would still be an issue.
C. Using SQS for data exchange between EC2 instances would require code changes to implement a messaging system rather than a shared file system.

           Because FSx for ONTAP provides THE SAME STORAGE via NFS and SMB. Duplication issue occured because Linux saved the files via NFS to one storage, then the data was copied to ANOTHER storage that shared it via SMB.

     It is D but I think NetApp ONTAP is an oversell in this context. They just needed a FSx solution not a whole expensive managed service...

     Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP 
Fully managed service offering shared storage between Linux and Windows file systems (Multi &amp; Single-AZ) up to petabytes datasets and 10+Gbps. 
- Allows Multi-protocol access to data using the  (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB), and Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) protocols
- Integrated with other AWS services (KMS, IAM, CloudTrail, amazon workspace)
- ideal solution to migrate, back up, or burst your file-based applications from on-prem to AWS without application code change.

     The key requirements are:

Simulation app runs on Linux, outputs data to NFS
Visualization app runs on Windows, requires SMB file system
Migrate apps to AWS without code changes
Eliminate data duplication and inefficient resource usage

     Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP is a fully-managed shared storage service built on NetApp's popular ONTAP file system. Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP provides the popular features, performance, and APIs of ONTAP file systems with the agility, scalability, and simplicity of a fully managed AWS service, making it easier for customers to migrate on-premises applications that rely on NAS appliances to AWS. FSx for ONTAP file systems are similar to on-premises NetApp clusters. Within each file system that you create, you also create one or more storage virtual machines (SVMs). These are isolated file servers each with their own endpoints for NFS, SMB, and management access, as well as authentication (for both administration and end-user data access). In turn, each SVM has one or more volumes which store your data.

     This solution is the most cost-efficient for the anticipated 100 monthly visits because:
• API Gateway charges are based on API calls. With only 100 visits, charges would be minimal.
• AWS Lambda provides compute time for the backend code in increments of 100ms, so charges would also be negligible for this workload.
• Amazon SES is used only for sending emails from the submitted contact forms. SES has a generous free tier of 62,000 emails per month, so there would be no charges for sending the contact emails.
• No EC2 instances or other infrastructure needs to be run and paid for.

     Create a t2 micro Amazon EC2 instance. Deploy a LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) stack to host the webpage (free open-source). Use client-side scripting to build the contact form. Integrate the form with Amazon WorkMail. This solution will provide the company with the necessary components to host the contact form page and integrate it with Amazon WorkMail at the lowest cost. Option A requires the use of Amazon ECS, which is more expensive than EC2, and Option B requires the use of Amazon API Gateway, which is also more expensive than EC2. Option C requires the use of Amazon Lightsail, which is more expensive than EC2.

     C. Invalidate the CloudFront cache.

Explanation:

Invalidate the CloudFront cache to ensure that the latest updates from the Git repository are reflected on the static website. When updates are made to the website's Git repository and deployed to Amazon S3, the CloudFront cache may still be serving the old cached content to users. By invalidating the CloudFront cache, you're instructing CloudFront to fetch fresh content from the origin (Amazon S3) and serve it to users.

     Since the static website is hosted behind CloudFront, updates made to the S3 bucket will not be visible on the site until the CloudFront cache expires or is invalidated. By invalidating the CloudFront cache after deploying updates, the latest version in S3 will be pulled and the updates will then appear on the live site.

     It is B:
A: Incorrect&gt; FSx file Gateway designed for low latency and efficient access to in-cloud FSx for Windows File Server file shares from your on-premises facility. 

B: Correct&gt; This solution will allow the company to host all three tiers on Amazon EC2 instances while using Amazon FSx for Windows File Server to provide Windows-based file sharing between the tiers. This will allow the company to use specific features of SQL Server, such as native backups and Data Quality Services, while sharing files for processing between the tiers.

C: Incorrect&gt; Currently, Amazon EFS supports the NFSv4.1 protocol and does not natively support the SMB protocol, and can't be used in Windows instances yet.

D: Incorrect&gt; Amazon EBS is a block-level storage solution that is typically used to store data at the operating system level, rather than for file sharing between servers.

     This design satisfies the needs in the following ways:
• Running all tiers on EC2 allows using SQL Server on EC2 with its native features like backups and Data Quality Services. SQL Server cannot be run directly on RDS.
• Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed Windows file storage with SMB access. This allows sharing files between the Windows EC2 instances for all three tiers.  
• FSx for Windows File Server has high performance, so it can handle file sharing needs between the tiers.

       The other options would not meet requirements:
A. FSx File Gateway only provides access to S3 or EFS storage. It cannot be used directly for Windows file sharing. 
C. RDS cannot run SQL Server or its native tools. The database tier needs to run on EC2. 
D. EBS volumes can only be attached to a single EC2 instance. They cannot be shared between tiers for file exchanges.

     C. 
Host the application tier and the business tier on Amazon EC2 instances. 
Host the database tier on Amazon RDS. 
Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for file sharing between the tiers.

This solution allows the company to use specific features of SQL Server such as native backups and Data Quality Services, by hosting the database tier on Amazon RDS. It also enables file sharing between the tiers using Amazon EFS, which is a fully managed, highly available, and scalable file system. Amazon EFS provides shared access to files across multiple instances, which is important for processing files between the tiers. Additionally, hosting the application and business tiers on Amazon EC2 instances provides the company with the flexibility to configure and manage the environment according to their requirements.

     This solution satisfies the needs in the following ways:
• EFS provides a fully managed elastic network file system that can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances concurrently.
• The EFS file system appears as a standard file system mount on the Linux web servers, requiring no application changes. The servers can access shared files as if they were on local storage.
• EFS is highly available, durable, and scalable, providing a robust shared storage solution.

       The other options would require modifying the application or do not provide a standard file system:
A. S3 does not provide a standard file system mount or share. The application would need to be changed to access S3 storage.
B. CloudFront is a content delivery network and caching service. It does not provide a file system mount or share and would require application changes. 
D. EBS volumes can only attach to a single EC2 instance. They cannot be mounted by multiple servers concurrently and do not provide a shared file system.

     C is the answer: 
Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. 
Mount the EFS file system on all web servers.

To meet the requirements of providing a shared file store for Linux-based web servers without making changes to the application, using an Amazon EFS file system is the best solution. 
Amazon EFS is a managed NFS file system service that provides shared access to files across multiple Linux-based instances, which makes it suitable for this use case.

Amazon S3 is not ideal for this scenario since it is an object storage service and not a file system, and it requires additional tools or libraries to mount the S3 bucket as a file system. 

Amazon CloudFront can be used to improve content delivery performance but is not necessary for this requirement. 

Additionally, Amazon EBS volumes can only be mounted to one instance at a time, so it is not suitable for sharing files across multiple instances.

     This solution satisfies the needs in the most secure manner:
• An IAM role provides temporary credentials to the Lambda function to access AWS resources. The function does not have persistent credentials. 
• The IAM policy grants least privilege access by specifying read access only to the specific S3 bucket needed. Access is not granted to all S3 buckets.
• If the Lambda function is compromised, the attacker would only gain access to the one specified S3 bucket. They would not receive broad access to resources.

       The other options are less secure:
A. A bucket policy grants open access to a resource. It is a less granular way to provide access and grants more privilege than needed.
C. Embedding access keys in code is extremely insecure and against best practices. The keys provide full access and are at major risk of compromise if the code leaks.
D. Granting access to all S3 buckets provides far too much privilege if only one bucket needs access. It greatly expands the impact if compromised.

     This is the most secure and recommended way to provide an AWS Lambda function with access to an S3 bucket. It involves creating an IAM role that the Lambda function assumes, and attaching an IAM policy to the role that grants the necessary permissions to read from the S3 bucket.

     There is a little trap here, because in the way this question is asked, both B and C are true since we don't know if it's production or not.

In a production environment C is absolutely forbidden and B is the good solution, we even have questions in this dump about this case.

In a dev environment spot instances are good if you don't care about stability so C can be a good answer.

Since this question is all about cost, let's go for the stingy rat solution, spot instances are cheaper, so C is correct.

     By using a mix of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances, the company can leverage the cost-effectiveness of Spot Instances for parts of their workload while ensuring the availability and reliability of On-Demand Instances for critical components. This approach allows for cost optimization without sacrificing performance or reliability.

     By combining On-Demand Instances for steady-state workloads or critical components and Spot Instances for less critical or burstable workloads, you can achieve a balance between cost savings and performance. This strategy allows you to optimize costs without making a long-term commitment, as Spot Instances provide cost savings without the need for upfront payments or long-term contracts.

     If the company wants to optimize cost savings without making a long-term commitment, then using only On-Demand Instances may not be the most cost-effective option. Spot Instances can be significantly cheaper than On-Demand Instances, but they come with the risk of being interrupted if the Spot price increases above your bid price. If the company is willing to accept this risk, a mix of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances may be the best option to optimize cost savings while maintaining the desired level of scalability.

However, if the company wants the most predictable pricing and does not want to risk instance interruption, then using only On-Demand Instances is a good choice. It ultimately depends on the company's priorities and risk tolerance.

     B. Signed URLs - This method allows the media company to control who can access the video content by creating a time-limited URL with a cryptographic signature. This URL can be distributed to the users who are unable to change the hardcoded URLs they are using for access, and they can access the content without needing to support cookies.

D. JSON Web Token (JWT) - This method allows the media company to control who can access the video content by creating a secure token that contains user authentication and authorization information. This token can be distributed to the users who are using a custom HTTP client that does not support cookies. The users can include this token in their requests to access the content without needing to support cookies.

Therefore, options B and D are the correct answers.

Option A (Signed cookies) would not work for users who are using a custom HTTP client that does not support cookies. Option C (AWS AppSync) is not relevant to the requirement of securing video content. Option E (AWS Secrets Manager) is a service used for storing and retrieving secrets, which is not relevant to the requirement of securing video content.

     B. Signed URLs: Signed URLs allow you to control access to your content in CloudFront by providing URLs that are valid only for a specified duration. This means users can access the content using the same URLs they have hardcoded, without the need for cookies or special client support.

D. JSON Web Token (JWT): JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) can be used to control access to resources by embedding authentication and authorization information in the token itself. Users can include the JWT in the request headers, allowing access to be controlled without relying on cookies. This approach doesn't require changes to hardcoded URLs and can be integrated into custom HTTP clients.

     Signed URLs and signed cookies are the most suitable options. They can effectively address the requirements of both users with custom HTTP clients and those with hardcoded URLs.

     B &amp; E - B. Signed URLs: This allows you to generate time-limited URLs with a signature that grants temporary access to specific resources in your S3 bucket. It doesn't rely on cookies and can be generated for users without requiring any changes to their HTTP client or hardcoded URLs. This method provides fine-grained control over access to your content.

E. AWS Secrets Manager: While AWS Secrets Manager can be useful for managing and rotating secrets, it is not directly related to securing S3 content in the context of the question. It's not one of the primary methods for securing access to S3 objects.

     To secure streaming video content from Amazon CloudFront, two methods are available: signed cookies or signed URLs. Customers can choose to use either one or both, depending on the use case.

     B and D are the correct options for meeting the requirements with the least impact to users.

Signed URLs allow access to individual objects in Amazon S3 for a specified time period without requiring cookies. This allows the custom HTTP client users to access content.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) allow users to get temporary access tokens that can be passed in requests. This allows users with hardcoded URLs to access content without updating URLs.

       No good
Signed cookies require client support and may impact users.

AWS AppSync and Secrets Manager do not help address the specific access requirements.

Good


So Signed URLs and JWTs allow securing access to S3 content with minimal impact to users, meeting the requirements.

     Signed cookies would allow the media company to authorize access to related content (like HLS video segments) with a single signature, minimizing implementation overhead. This works for users that can support cookies.
Signed URLs would allow the media company to sign each URL individually to control access, supporting users that cannot use cookies. By embedding the signature in the URL, existing hardcoded URLs would not need to change.

       C. AWS AppSync - This is for building data-driven apps with real-time and offline capabilities. It does not directly help with securing streaming content.
D. JSON Web Token (JWT) - Although JWTs can be used for authorization, they would require the client to get a token and validate/check access on the server for each request. This does not work for hardcoded URLs and minimizes impact.
E. AWS Secrets Manager - This service is for managing secrets, not for controlling access to resources. It would not meet the requirements.

     OK, for B I did some research, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job-streaming.html

"You can create streaming extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs that run continuously, consume data from streaming sources like Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Apache Kafka, and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). The jobs cleanse and transform the data, and then load the results into Amazon S3 data lakes or JDBC data stores."

     To transform real-time streaming data from multiple sources, write it to Amazon S3, and query the transformed data using SQL, the company can use the following solutions: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. The transformed data can be queried using Amazon Athena. Therefore, options A and E are the correct answers.

Option A is correct because it uses Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to stream data from multiple sources, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to transform the data, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to write the data to Amazon S3. Amazon Athena can be used to query the transformed data in Amazon S3.

Option E is also correct because it uses Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to stream data from multiple sources, AWS Glue to transform the data, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to write the data to Amazon S3. Amazon Athena can be used to query the transformed data in Amazon S3.

     The solutions that meet the requirements of streaming real-time data, transforming the data before writing to S3, and querying the transformed data using SQL are A and B.

Option C: This option is not ideal for streaming real-time data as AWS DMS is not optimized for real-time data ingestion.
Option D &amp; E: These option are not recommended as the Amazon RDS query editor is not designed for querying data in S3, and it is not efficient for running complex queries.

     1. The company wants to maintain local access to all the data. Only stored volumes keep the complete dataset on-premises, providing low-latency access. Cached volumes only cache a subset locally.
2. The company wants the data backed up on AWS. With stored volumes, periodic backups (snapshots) of the on-premises data are sent to S3, providing durable and scalable backup storage.
3. The company wants the data transfer to AWS to be automatic and secure. Storage Gateway provides an encrypted connection between the on-premises gateway and AWS storage. Backups to S3 are sent asynchronously and automatically based on the backup schedule configured.

     The Volume Gateway runs in either a cached or stored mode.
In the cached mode, your primary data is written to S3, while retaining your frequently accessed data locally in a cache for low-latency access.
In the stored mode, your primary data is stored locally and your entire dataset is available for low-latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS.

     The correct answer is B. Set up a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 in the VPC.

A gateway VPC endpoint is a private way for Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC to access AWS services, such as Amazon S3, without having to go through the internet. This can help to improve security and performance.

         Macie is for identifying the PII data. Here it's much simpler because one of the apps need the PII data and other apps don't so you don't need to identify the PII data as you know it is already there.

     [GPT4] while S3 Object Lambda is a powerful tool for real-time data transformation, it is not the best fit for processing very large datasets due to Lambda's execution limits(15 min). Instead, preprocessing the data and storing it in separate S3 buckets for each applicatin's needs is a more operationally efficient solution for the scenario describes.

     Because this is exactly what the AWS blog says.

"When you store data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), you can easily share it for use by multiple applications. However, each application has its own requirements and may need a different view of the data. For example, a dataset created by an e-commerce application may include personally identifiable information (PII) that is not needed when the same data is processed for analytics and should be redacted."

     B. Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. Process and transform the data by using S3 Object Lambda before returning the data to the requesting application.

This solution allows you to use S3 Object Lambda to process and transform the data on-the-fly as it is requested by each application. S3 Object Lambda enables you to apply custom code to your data retrieval requests, allowing you to remove PII before returning the data to the requesting application. This eliminates the need to create and manage separate storage locations for each application, reducing operational overhead.

     Why would you reprocess the data every time you request it when you can just filter it once and be done?
Because of this I think A and B are highly inefficient, leaving us with C and D as options.
Since S3 is better suited for Data Lakes, I think C is the answer.

       Chat GPT:

Isn't just  60 seconds the maximum duration for a Lambda function used by S3 Object Lambda? How can it process terabytes of data in 60 seconds?

You are correct that the maximum duration for a Lambda function used by S3 Object Lambda is 60 seconds.

Given the time constraint, it is not feasible to process terabytes of data within a single Lambda function execution. 

S3 Object Lambda is designed for lightweight and real-time transformations rather than extensive processing of large datasets.

To handle terabytes of data, you would typically need to implement a distributed processing solution using services like Amazon EMR, AWS Glue, or AWS Batch. These services are specifically designed to handle big data workloads and provide scalability and distributed processing capabilities.

So, while S3 Object Lambda can be useful for lightweight processing tasks, it is not the appropriate tool for processing terabytes of data within the execution time limits of a Lambda function.

     • Storing the raw data in S3 provides a durable, scalable data lake. S3 requires little ongoing management overhead.
• S3 Object Lambda can be used to filter and process the data on retrieval transparently. This minimizes operational overhead by avoiding the need to preprocess and store multiple transformed copies of the data.
• Only one copy of the data needs to be stored and maintained in S3. S3 Object Lambda will transform the data on read based on the requesting application.
• No additional applications or proxies need to be developed and managed to handle the data transformation. S3 Object Lambda provides this functionality.

     B is the correct answer.
Amazon S3 Object Lambda allows you to add custom code to S3 GET requests, which means that you can modify the data before it is returned to the requesting application. In this case, you can use S3 Object Lambda to remove the PII before the data is returned to the two applications that do not need to process PII. This approach has the least operational overhead because it does not require creating separate datasets or proxy application layers, and it allows you to maintain a single copy of the data in an S3 bucket.

     To meet the requirement of removing the PII before processing by two of the applications, it would be most efficient to use option B, which involves storing the data in an Amazon S3 bucket and using S3 Object Lambda to process and transform the data before returning it to the requesting application. This approach allows the PII to be removed in real-time and without the need to create separate datasets or tables for each application. S3 Object Lambda can be configured to automatically remove PII from the data before it is sent to the non-PII processing applications. This solution provides a cost-effective and scalable way to meet the requirement with the least operational overhead.

     • Option A (10.0.1.0/32) is invalid - a /32 CIDR prefix is a host route, not a VPC range.

• Option D (10.0.1.0/24) satisfies the non-overlapping CIDR requirement but is a larger block than needed. Since only two VPCs need to be peered, a /24 block provides more addresses than necessary.

     In an Amazon VPC, the first four and the last IP address in each subnet are reserved for specific purposes, and they cannot be used for customer instances. Here's how the reserved addresses are typically allocated:

Network Address (First IP):

The first IP address (all zeros in the host portion) in a subnet is reserved as the network address. For example, if you have a subnet with a CIDR notation of 10.0.0.0/24, the network address would be 10.0.0.0.
VPC Router (Second IP):

The second IP address in the subnet is reserved for the VPC router.
DNS Server (Third IP):

The third IP address is reserved for the DNS server.
Reserved for Future Use (Fourth IP):

The fourth IP address is reserved for future use.
Customer Instances (Fifth to Second-to-Last IP):

The IP addresses from the fifth to the second-to-last IP address in the subnet are available for customer instances.
Broadcast Address (Last IP):

The last IP address (all ones in the host portion) in a subnet is reserved as the broadcast address, even though AWS does not support broadcast.

     10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix): Example CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix): Example CIDR block: 172.31.0.0/16
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix): Example CIDR block: 192.168.0.0/20
Given that the development VPC already uses 192.168.0.0/24, we need to choose a non-overlapping CIDR block. The smallest valid CIDR block that meets the requirements is 192.168.1.0/24 (Option C).

     The correct answer is B.

This solution will meet the requirements because it will:

Automate the scalability of the application by using EC2 Auto Scaling.
Optimize the cost of the architecture by only scaling the number of EC2 instances up when needed.
Ensure that the application has enough CPU resources when surges occur by setting the target value of the target tracking scaling policy to 50%.

     Wrong answers: Options A, C, and D are not the most appropriate solutions:

Option A suggests creating a CloudWatch alarm to terminate an EC2 instance when CPU utilization is less than 20%. However, this approach does not ensure that the application will have enough CPU resources during surges, as it only terminates instances when CPU utilization is low, which may not meet the requirements.
Option C suggests creating an Auto Scaling group without any specific scaling policies or configurations. This approach does not address the need for automated scaling based on CPU utilization, making it insufficient for the given requirements.
Option D suggests using CloudWatch alarms to send notifications via Amazon SNS and manually adjusting the number of instances based on the received messages. This approach lacks automation and requires manual intervention, which does not optimize cost or meet the requirement of automated scalability.
Therefore, Option B is the most appropriate solution in this case.

     Explanation:
Option B leverages EC2 Auto Scaling, which is designed to automatically adjust the number of instances based on specified metrics. By setting a target tracking scaling policy based on average CPU utilization, the Auto Scaling group can dynamically scale the number of instances to maintain the desired level of CPU resources. The minimum instances of 2 ensure a minimum baseline capacity, while the desired capacity of 3 ensures at least three instances are running even during normal traffic. The maximum instances of 6 cap the upper limit to control costs.

       In the scenario you provided, you're setting up an Auto Scaling group to manage the instances for you, and the settings (min 2, desired 3, max 6) are for the Auto Scaling group, not for your existing instances. When you integrate the instances into the Auto Scaling group, you are effectively moving from a fixed instance count to a dynamic one that can range from 2 to 6 based on the demand.
The existing 5 instances can be included in the Auto Scaling group, but the group can reduce the number of instances if the load is low (to the minimum specified, which is 2 in this case) and can also add more instances (up to a maximum of 6) if the load increases.
      </p>

     Reasons:
• An Auto Scaling group will automatically scale the EC2 instances to match changes in demand. This optimizes cost by only running as many instances as needed.
• A target tracking scaling policy monitors the ASGAverageCPUUtilization metric and scales to keep the average CPU around the 50% target value. This ensures there are enough resources during CPU surges.
• The ALB and target group are reused, so the application architecture does not change. The Auto Scaling group is associated to the existing load balancer setup.
• A minimum of 2 and maximum of 6 instances provides the ability to scale between 3 and 6 instances as needed based on demand.
• Costs are optimized by starting with only 3 instances (the desired capacity) and scaling up as needed. When CPU usage drops, instances are terminated to match the desired capacity.

       Option A - terminates instances reactively based on low CPU and may not provide enough capacity during surges. Does not optimize cost.
Option C - lacks a scaling policy so will not automatically adjust capacity based on changes in demand. Does not ensure enough resources during surges.
Option D - requires manual intervention to scale capacity. Does not optimize cost or provide an automated solution.

     B is the correct solution because it allows for automatic scaling based on the average CPU utilization of the EC2 instances in the target group. With the use of a target tracking scaling policy based on the ASGAverageCPUUtilization metric, the EC2 Auto Scaling group can ensure that the target value of 50% is maintained while scaling the number of instances in the group up or down as needed. This will help ensure that the application has enough CPU resources during surges without overprovisioning, thus optimizing the cost of the architecture.

     An Auto Scaling group can span across two Availability Zones, where one subnet is created in each AZ.

When creating an Auto Scaling group, you need to specify at least one subnet. You can add additional subnets later on, including subnets across multiple AZs.

Auto Scaling will distribute instances evenly across the specified subnets to maintain availability and optimize performance. If one AZ becomes unavailable, instances can be launched in the other AZ.

The associated load balancer should also span the same subnets/AZs as the Auto Scaling group. This allows traffic to be routed to instances in different subnets and AZs, increasing fault tolerance of the application.

     Keyword here is a minimum throughput of 6 GBps. Only the FSx for Lustre with SSD option gives the sub-milli response and throughput of 6 GBps or more.
B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the raw data. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that uses persistent SSD storage. Select the option to import data from and export data to Amazon S3. Mount the file system on the EC2 instances.

     • Amazon FSx for Lustre with SSD storage can provide up to 260 GB/s of aggregate throughput and sub-millisecond latencies needed for this workload.
• Persistent SSD storage ensures data durability in the file system. Data is also exported to S3 for backup storage. 
• The file system will import the initial 8 TB of raw data from S3, providing a fast storage tier for processing while retaining the data in S3.
• The file system is mounted to the EC2 compute instances to distribute processing.
• FSx for Lustre is optimized for high-performance computing workloads running on Linux, matching the EC2 environment.

       Option A - FSx for NetApp ONTAP with ALL tiering policy would not provide fast enough storage tier for sub-millisecond latency. HDD tiers have higher latency.
Option C - FSx for Lustre with HDD storage would not provide the throughput, IOPS or low latency needed.
Option D - FSx for NetApp ONTAP with NONE tiering policy would require much more expensive SSD storage to meet requirements, increasing cost.

     B is the best choice as it utilizes Amazon S3 for data storage, which is cost-effective and durable, and Amazon FSx for Lustre for high-performance file storage, which provides the required sub-millisecond latencies and minimum throughput of 6 GBps. Additionally, the option to import and export data to and from Amazon S3 makes it easier to manage and move data between the two services.

     Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances allow for significant cost savings compared to On-Demand instances for long-running, steady-state workloads like this one. Reserved Instances provide a capacity reservation, so the instances are guaranteed to be available for the duration of the reservation period.

Amazon Aurora is a highly scalable, cloud-native relational database service that is designed to be compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. It can automatically scale up to meet growing storage requirements, so it can accommodate the application's database storage needs over time. By using Reserved Instances for Aurora, the cost savings will be significant over the long term.

       Since the application's database storage is continuously growing over time, it may be difficult to estimate the appropriate size of the Aurora cluster in advance, which is required when reserving Aurora.

In this case, it may be more cost-effective to use Amazon RDS On-Demand Instances for the data storage layer. With RDS On-Demand Instances, you pay only for the capacity you use and you can easily scale up or down the storage as needed.

That is, your reserved DB instances are automatically applied across all DB instance class sizes.

       Application runs 24x7 which means database is also used 24x7. The storage will grow and RDS On-Demand does not have auto-grow storage. You have to configure a storage size for RDS which means it will eventually run out of space. RDS On-Demand just scales CPU, not storage.

Aurora has no storage limitation and can scale storage according to need which is what is required here

     This option involves migrating the application layer to Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances and migrating the data storage layer to Amazon Aurora Reserved Instances. Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances provide a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand Instance pricing, making them a cost-effective choice for applications that have steady state or predictable usage. Similarly, Amazon Aurora Reserved Instances provide a significant discount (up to 69%) compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.

     To meet the requirements of migrating a legacy application from an on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud in a cost-effective manner, the most suitable option would be:

C. Migrate the application layer to Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances. Migrate the data storage layer to Amazon Aurora Reserved Instances.

Explanation:

Migrating the application layer to Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances allows you to reserve EC2 capacity in advance, providing cost savings compared to On-Demand Instances. This is especially beneficial if the application runs 24/7.

Migrating the data storage layer to Amazon Aurora Reserved Instances provides cost optimization for the growing database storage needs. Amazon Aurora is a fully managed relational database service that offers high performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.

     C: With Aurora Serverless v2, each writer and reader has its own current capacity value, measured in ACUs. Aurora Serverless v2 scales a writer or reader up to a higher capacity when its current capacity is too low to handle the load. It scales the writer or reader down to a lower capacity when its current capacity is higher than needed.

This is sufficient to accommodate the growing data changes.

     Typically Amazon RDS cost less than Aurora.  But here, it's Aurora reserved.

     AWS DataSync is a data transfer service that can copy large amounts of data between on-premises storage and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server at high speeds. It allows you to control the amount of bandwidth used during data transfer.
• DataSync uses agents at the source and destination to automatically copy files and file metadata over the network. This optimizes the data transfer and minimizes the impact on your network bandwidth.
• DataSync allows you to schedule data transfers and configure transfer rates to suit your needs. You can transfer 30 TB within 5 days while controlling bandwidth usage.
• DataSync can resume interrupted transfers and validate data to ensure integrity. It provides detailed monitoring and reporting on the progress and performance of data transfers.

       Option A - AWS Snowcone is more suitable for physically transporting data when network bandwidth is limited. It would not complete the transfer within 5 days.
Option B - Amazon FSx File Gateway only provides access to files stored in Amazon FSx and does not perform the actual data migration from on-premises to FSx. 
Option D - AWS Transfer Family is for transferring files over FTP, FTPS and SFTP. It may require scripting to transfer 30 TB and monitor progress, and lacks bandwidth controls.

     As read a little bit, I assume that B (FSx File Gateway) requires a little bit more configuration rather than C (DataSync). From Stephane Maarek course explanation about DataSync:
 An online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates copying large amounts of data between on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage services.

You can use AWS DataSync to migrate data located on-premises, at the edge, or in other clouds to Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon FSx for OpenZFS, and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP.

     Even if we allocate 60% of total bandwidth for the transfer, that would take 5d2h. Considering that " many other departments in the university share", that wouldn't be feasible. 
Ref. https://expedient.com/knowledgebase/tools-and-calculators/file-transfer-time-calculator/

On the other hand, snowcone isn't also a great option, because "you will receive the Snowcone device in approximately 4-6 days".
Ref. https://aws.amazon.com/snowcone/faqs/#:~:text=You%20will%20receive%20the%20Snowcone,console%20for%20each%20Snowcone%20device.

     Snow cone can support up to 8TB for HDD and 15TB for each SSD devices. Shipped within 4-6 days. Data migration can begin on next 5 days.

Does not use any amount of bandwidth and impact the production network. Device came with 1G and 10G Base-T Ethernet port. That's the Maximum performance in data transfer. defined in the question.

Transferring hot or cold data should not impede your business. DataSync is equipped with granular controls to optimize bandwidth consumptions. Throttle transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps during off hours and set limits when network availability is needed elsewhere

A. Snowcone is incorrect. The question says data migration must take place within the next 5 days.AWS says: If you order, you will receive the Snowcone device in approximately 4-6 days.

     DataSync can be used to migrate data between on-premises Windows file servers and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with its compatibility for Windows file systems.

The laboratory needs to migrate a large amount of data (30 TB) within a relatively short timeframe (5 days) and limit the impact on other departments' network traffic. Therefore, AWS DataSync can meet these requirements by providing fast and efficient data transfer with network throttling capability to control bandwidth usage.

     Target tracking will scale in/out the ECS cluster to maintain the average CPU utilization to a set value. e.g. &lt;&lt;&lt;50%&gt;&gt;&gt; Scale out when average CPU utilization is above 50% until average CPU utilization is back to 50%. And scale in when average CPU utilization is below 50% until average CPU utilization is back to 50%.

     AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies moving large amounts of data between on-premises storage systems and AWS services. It can also transfer data between different AWS services, including different AWS Regions. DataSync provides a simple, scalable, and automated solution to transfer data, and it minimizes the operational overhead because it is fully managed by AWS.

     AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies moving large amounts of data between on-premises storage systems and AWS services. It can also transfer data between different AWS services, including different AWS Regions. DataSync provides a simple, scalable, and automated solution to transfer data, and it minimizes the operational overhead because it is fully managed by AWS.

     • AWS DataSync is a data transfer service optimized for moving large amounts of data between NFS file systems. It can automatically copy files and metadata between your NFS file systems in different AWS Regions.
• DataSync requires minimal setup and management. You deploy a source and destination agent, provide the source and destination locations, and DataSync handles the actual data transfer efficiently in the background. 
• DataSync can schedule and monitor data transfers to keep source and destination in sync with minimal overhead. It resumes interrupted transfers and validates data integrity. 
• DataSync optimizes data transfer performance across AWS's network infrastructure. It can achieve high throughput with minimal impact to your operations.

       Option B - AWS Snowball requires physical devices to transfer data. This incurs overhead to transport devices and manually load/unload data. It is not an online data transfer solution. 
Option C - Setting up and managing an SFTP server would require provisioning EC2 instances, handling security groups, and writing scripts to automate the data transfer - all of which demand more overhead than DataSync.
Option D - AWS Database Migration Service is designed for migrating databases, not general file system data. It would require converting your NFS data into a database format, incurring additional overhead.

       Option A - DataSync is for data transfer, not providing a shared file system. It cannot be mounted or directly accessed.
Option B - A self-managed EC2 file share would require manually installing, configuring and maintaining a Windows file system and share. This demands significant overhead to operate.
Option D - Amazon S3 is object storage, not a native file system. The data in S3 would need to be converted/formatted to provide file share access, adding complexity. S3 cannot be directly mounted or provide the performance of FSx.

     Reasons:
• Launching instances within a single AZ and using a cluster placement group provides the lowest network latency and highest bandwidth between instances. This maximizes performance for an in-memory database and high-throughput application.
• Communications between instances in the same AZ and placement group are free, minimizing data transfer charges. Inter-AZ and public IP traffic can incur charges. 
• A cluster placement group enables the instances to be placed close together within the AZ, allowing the high network throughput required. Partition groups span AZs, reducing bandwidth.
• Auto Scaling across zones could launch instances in AZs that increase data transfer charges. It may reduce network throughput, impacting performance.

       In contrast: 
Option B - A partition placement group spans AZs, reducing network bandwidth between instances and potentially increasing costs. 
Option C - Auto Scaling alone does not guarantee the network throughput and cost controls required for this use case. Launching across AZs could increase data transfer charges.
Option D - Step scaling policies determine how many instances to launch based on metrics alone. They lack control over network connectivity and costs between instances after launch.

     Answer would be A - As part of selecting all the EC2 instances in the same availability zone, they all will be within the same DC and logically the latency will be very less as compared to the other Availability Zones..

As all the autoscaling nodes will also be on the same availability zones, (as per Placement groups with Cluster mode), this would provide  the low-latency network performance

     A placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone, and it provides low-latency network connectivity between instances. By launching all EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone and specifying a placement group with cluster strategy, the application can take advantage of the high network throughput and low latency network connectivity that placement groups provide.

     AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway provides two configurations for connecting to iSCSI storage, namely, stored volumes and cached volumes. The stored volume configuration stores the entire data set on-premises and asynchronously backs up the data to AWS. The cached volume configuration stores recently accessed data on-premises, and the remaining data is stored in Amazon S3.

Since the company wants only its recently accessed data to remain stored locally, the cached volume configuration would be the most appropriate. It allows the company to keep frequently accessed data on-premises and reduce the need for scaling its iSCSI storage while still providing access to all data through the AWS cloud. This configuration also provides low-latency access to frequently accessed data and cost-effective off-site backups for less frequently accessed data.

       You're correct but a small mistake that the stored volume configuration stores the entire data set on-premises and asynchronously backs up the data to AWS (S3). The cached volume is low latency access to most recent data.

     The best AWS solution to meet the requirements is to use AWS Storage Gateway cached volumes (option D).

The key points:

Company migrating on-prem app servers to AWS
Want to minimize scaling on-prem iSCSI storage
Only recent data should remain on-premises
The AWS Storage Gateway cached volumes allow the company to connect their on-premises iSCSI storage to AWS cloud storage. It stores frequently accessed data locally in the cache for low-latency access, while older data is stored in AWS.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

     • Volume Gateway cached volumes store entire datasets on S3, while keeping a portion of recently accessed data on your local storage as a cache. This meets the goal of minimizing on-premises storage needs while keeping hot data local. 
• The cache provides low-latency access to your frequently accessed data, while long-term retention of the entire dataset is provided durable and cost-effective in S3. 
• You get virtually unlimited storage on S3 for your infrequently accessed data, while controlling the amount of local storage used for cache. This simplifies on-premises storage scaling. 
• Volume Gateway cached volumes support iSCSI connections from on-premises application servers, allowing a seamless migration experience. Servers access local cache and S3 storage volumes as iSCSI LUNs.

       In contrast: 
Option A - S3 File Gateway only provides file interfaces (NFS/SMB) to data in S3. It does not support block storage or cache recently accessed data locally. 
Option B - Tape Gateway is designed for long-term backup and archiving to virtual tape cartridges on S3. It does not provide primary storage volumes or local cache for low-latency access. 
Option C - Volume Gateway stored volumes keep entire datasets locally, then asynchronously back them up to S3. This does not meet the goal of minimizing on-premises storage needs.

     The answer is either BC or BD, depending on how you interpret "The company runs several active...  instances for 90 days for 90 days."

D: it assumes the instances will only run for 90 days, so reserved instances can't be the answer, since it requires 1-3 years utilization.

C: it assumes there is no idle instances since they've been active for the last 90 days.

     B: Use the Trusted Advisor recommendations from the consolidated billing account to see all RDS instance checks at the same time. This option allows the finance team to see all RDS instance checks across all AWS accounts in one place. Since the company uses consolidated billing, this account will have access to all of the AWS accounts' Trusted Advisor recommendations.

C: Review the Trusted Advisor check for Amazon RDS Reserved Instance Optimization. This check can help identify cost savings opportunities for RDS by identifying instances that can be covered by Reserved Instances. This can result in significant savings on RDS costs.

     "you can reserve a DB instance for a one- or three-year term". We only have data for 90 days. I feel it too risky to commit for 1/3 year(s) without information on future usage. If we knew that we expected the same usage pattern for the next 1,2,3 years, Id agree with C.

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online resource to help you reduce cost, increase performance, and improve security by optimizing your AWS environment. (...) Recommendations are based on the previous calendar month's hour-by-hour usage aggregated across all consolidated billing accounts. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-reservation-models/aws-trusted-advisor.html

Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance Optimization: An important part of using AWS involves balancing your Reserved Instance (RI) purchase against your On-Demand Instance usage. This check provides recommendations on which RIs will help reduce the costs incurred from using On-Demand Instances. We create these recommendations by analyzing your On-Demand usage for the past 30 days. We then categorizing the usage into eligible categories for reservations.

     If you're choosing D for the idle instances, Amazon RDS Reserved Instance Optimization Trusted Advisor check includes recommendations related to underutilized and idle RDS instances. It helps identify instances that are not fully utilized and provides recommendations on how to optimize costs, such as resizing or terminating unused instances, or purchasing reserved instances to match usage patterns more efficiently.

     Reserved Instances can be shared across accounts, and that is the reason why we need to check the consolidated bill.

we don't want to check Idle instances because the instances were active for last 90 days.
Idle means it was inactive for at least 7 days.

     Reserved Instance Optimization "checks your usage of RDS and provides recommendations on purchase of Reserved Instances to help reduce costs incurred from using RDS On-Demand." In other words, it is not about optimizing reserved instances (as many here think), it about optimizing on-demand instances by converting them to reserved ones.

"Idle DB Instances" check is about databases that have "not had a connection for a prolonged period of time", which we know is not the case here.

     why no one considers AD. C is not the option since reserved instance is considered in case of long-term usage while it is 90 days here. But B is using consolidated  billing which covers the high level billing overview of cost but not that specific for RDS running instance. should we only need to use Trust advisor for accounts where RDS is running?

     On the other hand, Option B suggests using the S3 dashboard in the AWS Management Console, which provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface to monitor S3 bucket access patterns. This option may have less operational overhead compared to setting up and managing Storage Lens. Additionally, for simply identifying rarely accessed buckets, the built-in metrics and access analysis provided by the S3 dashboard can often suffice without the need for advanced analytics offered by Storage Lens. Therefore, Option B is considered to have less operational overhead for the specific task described in the question.

     But nowhere on S3 Storage Lens dashboard this information is available; that when the bucket is accessed last time. But it gives insight on the bucket's size. with this information we can check if files can be moved to less costly storage class. This way we can reduce storage cost..... The information which is the main requirement of the given scenario, is available when we use Cloudtrail logs ... so i choose option D.

     A missed turning on monitoring. It can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill. By default, Amazon S3 doesn't collect server access logs. When you enable logging, Amazon S3 delivers access logs for a source bucket to a target bucket that you choose.

I could not find that S3 storage Lens examples online showing using Lens to identify idle S3 buckets. Instead I find using S3 Access Logging. Hmm.

       B) The standard S3 console dashboard provides basic info but would require manually analyzing metrics for each bucket. This does not scale well and requires significant overhead.
C) Turning on the BucketSizeBytes metric and analyzing the data in Athena may provide insights but would require enabling metrics, building Athena queries, and analyzing the results. This requires more operational effort than option A.
D) Enabling CloudTrail logging and monitoring the logs in CloudWatch Logs could provide access pattern data but would require setting up CloudTrail, monitoring the logs, and analyzing the relevant info. This option has the highest operational overhead

     To reduce the cost associated with data transfers and maintain or improve performance, a solutions architect should use Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.

Deploying a CloudFront distribution with the existing S3 bucket as the origin will allow the company to serve the data to customers from edge locations that are closer to them, reducing data transfer costs and improving performance.

Directing customer requests to the CloudFront URL and switching to CloudFront signed URLs for access control will enable customers to access the data securely and efficiently.

     B.
1. Amazon CloudFront caches content at edge locations -- reducing the need for frequent data transfer from S3 bucket -- thus significantly lowering data transfer costs (as compared to directly serving data from S3 bucket to customers in different regions)
2. CloudFront delivers content to users from the nearest edge location -- minimizing latency -- improves performance for customers

A - focus on accelerating uploads to S3 which may not necessarily improve the performance needed for serving datasets to customers
C - helps with redundancy and data availability but does not necessarily offer cost savings for data transfer.
D - complex to implement, does not address data transfer cost

     Quote types need to be separated: SNS message filtering can be used to publish messages to the appropriate SQS queue based on the quote type, ensuring that quotes are separated by type.
Quotes must be responded to within 24 hours and must not get lost: SQS provides reliable and scalable queuing for messages, ensuring that quotes will not get lost and can be processed in a timely manner. Additionally, each backend application server can use its own SQS queue, ensuring that quotes are processed efficiently without any delay.
Operational efficiency and minimizing maintenance: Using a single SNS topic and multiple SQS queues is a scalable and cost-effective approach, which can help to maximize operational efficiency and minimize maintenance. Additionally, SNS and SQS are fully managed services, which means that the company will not need to worry about maintenance tasks such as software updates, hardware upgrades, or scaling the infrastructure.

     Option C would be the most suitable solution to meet the requirements while maximizing operational efficiency and minimizing maintenance.

Explanation:

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) allows for the creation of a single topic to which multiple subscribers can be attached. In this scenario, each quote type can be considered a subscriber. Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) queues can be subscribed to the SNS topic, and SNS message filtering can be used to direct messages to the appropriate SQS queue based on the quote type. This setup ensures that quotes are separated by quote type and that they are not lost. Each backend application server can then poll its own SQS queue to retrieve and process messages. This architecture is efficient, scalable, and requires minimal maintenance, as it leverages managed AWS services without the need for complex custom code or infrastructure setup.

     Create a single SNS topic
Subscribe separate SQS queues per quote type
Use SNS message filtering to send messages to proper queue
Backend servers poll their respective SQS queue
The key points:

Quote requests must be processed within 24 hrs without loss
Need to maximize efficiency and minimize maintenance
Requests separated by quote type

     Amazon Aurora Serverless for MySQL is a fully managed, auto-scaling relational database service that scales up or down automatically based on the application demand. This service provides all the capabilities of Amazon Aurora, such as high availability, durability, and security, without requiring the customer to provision any database instances.

With Amazon Aurora Serverless for MySQL, the sales team can enjoy minimal downtime since the database is designed to automatically scale to accommodate the increased traffic. Additionally, the service allows the customer to pay only for the capacity used, making it cost-effective for infrequent access patterns.

Amazon RDS for MySQL could also be an option, but it requires the customer to select an instance type, and the database administrator would need to monitor and adjust the instance size manually to accommodate the increasing traffic.

     Amazon Inspector:
• Performs active vulnerability scans of EC2 instances. It looks for software vulnerabilities, unintended network accessibility, and other security issues.
• Requires installing an agent on EC2 instances to perform scans. The agent must be deployed to each instance.
• Provides scheduled scan reports detailing any findings of security risks or vulnerabilities. These reports can be used to patch or remediate issues.
• Is best suited for proactively detecting security weaknesses and misconfigurations in your AWS environment.

       Amazon GuardDuty:
• Monitors for malicious activity like unusual API calls, unauthorized infrastructure deployments, or compromised EC2 instances. It uses machine learning and behavioral analysis of logs.
• Does not require installing any agents. It relies on analyzing AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.
• Alerts you to any detected threats, suspicious activity or policy violations in your AWS accounts. These alerts warrant investigation but may not always require remediation.
• Is focused on detecting active threats, unauthorized behavior, and signs of a compromise in your AWS environment.
• Can also detect some vulnerabilities and misconfigurations but coverage is not as broad as a dedicated service like Inspector.

     Amazon Inspector is a security assessment service that helps to identify security vulnerabilities and compliance issues in applications deployed on Amazon EC2 instances. It can be used to assess the security of applications that are deployed on Amazon EC2 instances, including those that are custom-built.

To use Amazon Inspector, the Amazon Inspector agent must be installed on the EC2 instances that need to be assessed. The agent collects data about the instances and sends it to Amazon Inspector for analysis. Amazon Inspector then generates a report that details any security vulnerabilities that were found and provides guidance on how to remediate them.

By configuring an AWS Lambda function, the company can automate the generation and distribution of reports that detail the findings. This means that reports can be generated and distributed as soon as vulnerabilities are detected, allowing the company to take action quickly.

     By migrating the script to AWS Lambda, the company can take advantage of the auto-scaling feature of the service. AWS Lambda will automatically scale resources to match the size of the workload. This means that the company will not have to worry about provisioning or managing instances as the number of messages increases, resulting in lower operational costs

     The key points are:

Currently using an EC2 instance to poll SQS and process messages
Want to reduce costs while handling growing message volume
By migrating the polling script to a Lambda function, the company can avoid the cost of running a dedicated EC2 instance. Lambda functions scale automatically to handle message spikes. And Lambda billing is based on actual usage, resulting in cost savings versus provisioned EC2 capacity.

     AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. By migrating the script to an AWS Lambda function, you can eliminate the need to maintain an EC2 instance, reducing operational costs. Additionally, Lambda automatically scales to handle the increasing number of messages in the SQS queue.

     It Should be C. 
Lambda allows you to execute code without provisioning or managing servers, so it is ideal for running scripts that poll for and process messages in an Amazon SQS queue. The scaling of the Lambda function is automatic, and you only pay for the actual time it takes to process the messages.

     Time to sell some Glue.

     A, AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service that can extract data from various sources, transform it into the required format, and load it into a target data store. In this case, the ETL job can be configured to read the CSV files from Amazon S3, transform the data into a format that can be loaded into Amazon Redshift, and load it into an Amazon Redshift table.
B requires the development of a custom script to convert the CSV files to SQL files, which could be time-consuming and introduce additional operational overhead. C, while using serverless technology, requires the additional use of DynamoDB to store the processed data, which may not be necessary if the data is only needed in Amazon Redshift. D, while an option, is not the most efficient solution as it requires the creation of an EMR cluster, which can be costly and complex to manage.

     B - Developing a script is surely not minimizing operational effort
C - Stores data in DynamoDB where the new app cannot use it
D - Could work but is total overkill (EMR is for Big Data analysis, not for simple ETL)

     Create an AWS Glue ETL job to process the CSV files
Configure the job to run on a schedule
Output the transformed data to Amazon Redshift
The key points:

Legacy app generates CSV files in S3
New app requires data in Redshift or S3

     o meet the requirement with the least operational overhead, a serverless approach should be used. Among the options provided, option C provides a serverless solution using AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB. Therefore, the solution should be to create an AWS Lambda function and an Amazon DynamoDB table. Use an S3 event to invoke the Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to perform an extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to process the .csv files and store the processed data in the DynamoDB table.
Option A is also a valid solution, but it may involve more operational overhead than Option C. With Option A, you would need to set up and manage an AWS Glue job, which would require more setup time than creating an AWS Lambda function. Additionally, AWS Glue jobs have a minimum execution time of 10 minutes, which may not be necessary or desirable for this use case. However, if the data processing is particularly complex or requires a lot of data transformation, AWS Glue may be a more appropriate solution.

       Important point: The COTS performs complex SQL queries to analyze data in Amazon Redshift. If you use DynamoDB -&gt; No SQL querires. Option A makes more sense.

       Creating and maintaining a Lambda function is more "operational overhead" than using a ready-made service such as Glue. But more important, answer C says "store the processed data in the DynamoDB table" while the application can "analyze data that is stored in Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3 only".

     A would be the best solution as it involves the least operational overhead. With this solution, an AWS Glue ETL job is created to process the .csv files and store the processed data directly in Amazon Redshift. This is a serverless approach that does not require any infrastructure to be provisioned, configured, or maintained. AWS Glue provides a fully managed, pay-as-you-go ETL service that can be easily configured to process data from S3 and load it into Amazon Redshift. This approach allows the legacy application to continue to produce data in the CSV format that it currently uses, while providing the new COTS application with the ability to analyze the data using complex SQL queries.

     A. Enable AWS CloudTrail and use it for auditing. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS SDKs and APIs. By enabling CloudTrail, the company can track user activity and changes to AWS resources, and monitor compliance with internal policies and external regulations.

D. Enable AWS Config and create rules for auditing and compliance purposes. AWS Config provides a detailed inventory of the AWS resources in your account, and continuously records changes to the configurations of those resources. By creating rules in AWS Config, the company can automate the evaluation of resource configurations against desired state, and receive alerts when configurations drift from compliance.

Options B, C, and E are not directly relevant to the requirement of tracking and auditing inventory and configuration changes.

     A) Enable AWS CloudTrail and use it for auditing.
AWS CloudTrail provides a record of API calls and can be used to audit changes made to EC2 instances and security groups. By analyzing CloudTrail logs, the solutions architect can track who provisioned oversized instances or modified security groups without proper approval.
D) Enable AWS Config and create rules for auditing and compliance purposes.
AWS Config can record the configuration changes made to resources like EC2 instances and security groups. The solutions architect can create AWS Config rules to monitor for non-compliant changes, like launching certain instance types or opening security group ports without permission. AWS Config would alert on any violations of these rules.

       The other options would not fully meet the auditing and change tracking requirements:
B) Data lifecycle policies control when EC2 instances are backed up or deleted but do not audit configuration changes.
C) AWS Trusted Advisor security checks may detect some compliance violations after the fact but do not comprehensively log changes like AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config do.
E) CloudFormation templates enable rollback but do not provide an audit trail of changes. The solutions architect would not know who made unauthorized modifications in the first place.

     Answer is A
 Using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to connect to the EC2 instances is a secure option as it eliminates the need for inbound SSH ports and removes the requirement to manage SSH keys manually. It also provides a complete audit trail of user activity. This solution requires no additional software to be installed on the EC2 instances.

     The key reasons why:

STS can generate short-lived credentials that provide temporary access to the EC2 instances for administering them.
The credentials can be generated on-demand each time access is needed, eliminating the risks of using permanent shared SSH keys.
No infrastructure like bastion hosts needs to be maintained.
The on-premises administrators can use the familiar SSH tools with the temporary keys.

     Using AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to generate one-time SSH keys on demand is a secure and efficient way to provide access to the EC2 instances without the need for shared SSH keys. STS is a fully managed service that can be used to generate temporary security credentials, allowing systems administrators to connect to the EC2 instances without having to share SSH keys. The temporary credentials can be generated on demand, reducing the administrative overhead associated with managing SSH access

       Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability. With Session Manager, you can manage your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs). You can use either an interactive one-click browser-based shell or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). Session Manager provides secure and auditable node management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys. Session Manager also allows you to comply with corporate policies that require controlled access to managed nodes, strict security practices, and fully auditable logs with node access details, while providing end users with simple one-click cross-platform access to your managed nodes.

         Who should use Session Manager?
Any AWS customer who wants to improve their security and audit posture, reduce operational overhead by centralizing access control on managed nodes, and reduce inbound node access.

Information Security experts who want to monitor and track managed node access and activity, close down inbound ports on managed nodes, or allow connections to managed nodes that don't have a public IP address.

Administrators who want to grant and revoke access from a single location, and who want to provide one solution to users for Linux, macOS, and Windows Server managed nodes.

Users who want to connect to a managed node with just one click from the browser or AWS CLI without having to provide SSH keys.

     A:  is the solution for the company's requirements. Publishing data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams can support ingestion rates as high as 1 MB/s and provide real-time data processing. Kinesis Data Analytics can query the ingested data in real-time with low latency, and the solution can scale as needed to accommodate increases in ingestion rates or querying needs. This solution also ensures minimal data loss in the event of an EC2 instance reboot since Kinesis Data Streams has a persistent data store for up to 7 days by default.

     The fact they specifically mention "near real-time" twice tells me the correct answer is KDF. On top of which its easier to setup and maintain. KDS is really only needed if you need real-time. Also using redshift will mean permanent data retention. The data in A could be lost after a year. Redshift queries are slow but you're still querying near real-time data

     Option A is actually correct. The question ask for minimal data loss and that query of data should be near real time, not the ingestion. Kinesis data analytics is near real time.

Recent changes to Redshift actually make B correct as well, but A is also correct.

       Streaming ingestion provides low-latency, high-speed ingestion of stream data from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka into an Amazon Redshift provisioned or Amazon Redshift Serverless materialized view.[1] 

Option B mentions Kinesis Data Firehose (now just Firehose), so this won't work.

Option A is the correct answer.

     Comparison to other options:

B. Kinesis Data Firehose with Redshift: While Redshift is scalable, it doesn't offer real-time querying capabilities. Data needs to be loaded into Redshift from Firehose, introducing latency.
C. EC2 instance store with Kinesis Data Firehose and S3: Storing data in an EC2 instance store is not persistent and data will be lost during reboots. EBS volumes are more appropriate for persistent storage, but the architecture becomes more complex.
D. EBS volume with ElastiCache and Redis: While ElastiCache offers fast in-memory storage, it's not designed for high-volume data ingestion like 1 MB/s. It might struggle with scalability and persistence.

     Read the question: near real-time querying of data.... it is more about real-time data query once the data is ingested, It does not mention how long time the data needs to be stored. A is better option. B introduces delay of data buffer before it can be queried in redshift

     A is not correct because Kinesis can only store data up to 1 year. The solution need to support querying ALL data instead of "recent" data.

     A: is the solution for the company's requirements. Publishing data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams can support ingestion rates as high as 1 MB/s and provide real-time data processing. Kinesis Data Analytics can query the ingested data in real-time with low latency, and the solution can scale as needed to accommodate increases in ingestion rates or querying needs. This solution also ensures minimal data loss in the event of an EC2 instance reboot since Kinesis Data Streams has a persistent data store for up to 7 days by default.

     • Provide near-real-time data ingestion into Kinesis Data Streams with the ability to handle the 1 MB/s ingestion rate. Data would be stored redundantly across shards.
• Enable near-real-time querying of the data using Kinesis Data Analytics. SQL queries can be run directly against the Kinesis data stream.
• Minimize data loss since data is replicated across shards. If an EC2 instance is rebooted, the data stream is still accessible.
• Scale seamlessly to handle varying ingestion and query rates.

     Answer is A as it will provide a more streamlined solution. 
Using B (Firehose + Redshift) will involve sending the data to an S3 bucket first and then copying the data to Redshift which will take more time.

     Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose can deliver data in real-time to Amazon Redshift, making it immediately available for queries. Amazon Redshift, on the other hand, is a powerful data analytics service that allows fast and scalable querying of large volumes of data.

       The other options would not fully meet the requirements:
B) Kinesis Firehose + Redshift would introduce latency since data must be loaded from Firehose into Redshift before querying. Redshift would lack real-time capabilities.
C) An EC2 instance store and Kinesis Firehose to S3 with Athena querying would risk data loss from instance store if an instance reboots. Athena querying data in S3 also lacks real-time capabilities. 
D) Using EBS storage, Kinesis Firehose to Redis and subscribing to Redis may provide near-real-time ingestion and querying but risks data loss if an EBS volume or EC2 instance fails. Recovery requires re-hydrating data from a backup which impacts real-time needs.

     The x-amz-server-side-encryption header is used to specify the encryption method that should be used to encrypt objects uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. By updating the bucket policy to deny if the PutObject does not have this header set, the solutions architect can ensure that all objects uploaded to the bucket are encrypted.

     Related reading because (as of Jan 2023) S3 buckets have encryption enabled by default.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html

"If you require your data uploads to be encrypted using only Amazon S3 managed keys, you can use the following bucket policy. For example, the following bucket policy denies permissions to upload an object unless the request includes the x-amz-server-side-encryption header to request server-side encryption:"

     To encrypt an object at the time of upload, you need to add a header called x-amz-server-side-encryption to the request to tell S3 to encrypt the object using SSE-C, SSE-S3, or SSE-KMS. The following code example shows a Put request using SSE-S3.

       The other options would not enforce encryption:
A) Requiring an s3:x-amz-acl header does not mandate encryption. This header controls access permissions.
B) Requiring an s3:x-amz-acl header set to private also does not enforce encryption. It only enforces private access permissions.
C) Requiring an aws:SecureTransport header ensures uploads use SSL but does not specify that objects must be encrypted. Encryption is not required when using SSL transport.

     To ensure that all objects uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket are encrypted, the solutions architect should update the bucket policy to deny any PutObject requests that do not have an x-amz-server-side-encryption header set. This will prevent any objects from being uploaded to the bucket unless they are encrypted using server-side encryption.

     Use a custom AWS Lambda function to generate the thumbnail and alert the user. Lambda functions are well-suited for short-lived, stateless operations like generating thumbnails, and they can be triggered by various events, including image uploads. By using Lambda, the application can quickly confirm that the image was uploaded successfully and then asynchronously generate the thumbnail. When the thumbnail is generated, the Lambda function can send a message to the user to confirm that the thumbnail is ready.

C proposes to use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) message queue to process image uploads and generate thumbnails. SQS can help decouple the image upload process from the thumbnail generation process, which is helpful for asynchronous processing. However, it may not be the most suitable option for quickly alerting the user that the image was received, as the user may have to wait until the thumbnail is generated before receiving a notification.

     - Option A would not provide high availability. A single EC2 instance is a single point of failure. 
- Option B provides a scalable, highly available solution using serverless services. API Gateway and Lambda can scale automatically, and DynamoDB provides a durable data store.
- Option C would expose the Lambda function directly to the public Internet, which is not a recommended architecture. API Gateway provides an abstraction layer and additional features like access control.
- Option D requires configuring a VPN to AWS which adds complexity. It also saves the raw sensor data to S3, rather than processing it and storing the results.

     The correct answer is B. Create an HTTPS endpoint in Amazon API Gateway. Configure the API Gateway endpoint to invoke an AWS Lambda function to process the messages and save the results to an Amazon DynamoDB table.

Here are the reasons why:

API Gateway is a highly scalable and available service that can be used to create and expose RESTful APIs.
Lambda is a serverless compute service that can be used to process events and data.
DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that can be used to store data in a scalable and highly available way.

     Deploy Amazon API Gateway as an HTTPS endpoint and AWS Lambda to process and save the messages to an Amazon DynamoDB table. This option provides a highly available and scalable solution that can easily handle large amounts of data. It also integrates with other AWS services, making it easier to analyze and visualize the data for the security team.

     Bad question. No RTO/RPO, so impossible to properly answer. They probably want to hear option D. 

Depending on RPO, option B is also an adequate solution (data remains immediately accessible without experiencing latency via existing infrastructure, backup to cloud for DR). Also, this option requires LESS changes to existing infra than A. Only argument against B is that VTLs are usually used for legacy DR solutions, not for new ones, where object storage such as S3 is usually supported natively.

     From chatGPT4
Considering the requirements of minimal infrastructure change, immediate file access, and low-latency, Option C: Provisioning an AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway (cached volume) with a 10 TB local cache, seems to be the most fitting solution. This setup aligns with the existing iSCSI setup and provides a local cache for low-latency access, while also configuring scheduled snapshots for disaster recovery. In the event of a disaster, restoring a snapshot to an Amazon EBS volume and attaching it to an Amazon EC2 instance as described in this option would align with the recovery objective.

To have immediate access to the data. Cached is for frequently accessed data only.

       The stored volume configuration stores the entire data set on-premises and asynchronously backs up the data to AWS. The cached volume configuration stores recently accessed data on-premises, and the remaining data is stored in Amazon S3

     In the cached mode, your primary data is written to S3, while retaining your frequently accessed data locally in a cache for low-latency access.
In the stored mode, your primary data is stored locally and your entire dataset is available for low-latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS.

     To resolve the issue and provide proper permissions for users to access the protected content, the recommended solution is:

A. Update the Amazon Cognito identity pool to assume the proper IAM role for access to the protected content.

Explanation:

Amazon Cognito provides authentication and user management services for web and mobile applications.
In this scenario, the application is using Amazon Cognito as an identity provider to authenticate users and obtain JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
The JWTs are used to access protected resources stored in another S3 bucket.
To grant users access to the protected content, the proper IAM role needs to be assumed by the identity pool in Amazon Cognito.
By updating the Amazon Cognito identity pool with the appropriate IAM role, users will be authorized to access the protected content in the S3 bucket.

       Option B is incorrect because updating the S3 ACL (Access Control List) will only affect the permissions of the application, not the users accessing the content.

Option C is incorrect because redeploying the application to Amazon S3 will not resolve the issue related to user access permissions.

Option D is incorrect because updating custom attribute mappings in Amazon Cognito will not directly grant users the proper permissions to access the protected content.

     IAM role is assinged to IAM users or groups or assumed by AWS service. So IAM role is given to AWS Cognito service which provides temporary AWS credentials to authenticated users. so technically When a user is authenticated by Cognito, they receive temporary credentials based on the IAM role tied to the Cognito identity pool. If this IAM role has permissions to access certain S3 buckets or objects, the authenticated user will be able to access those resources as allowed by the role. This service is used under the hood by Cognito to provide these temporary credentials. The credentials are limited in time and scope based on the permissions defined in the IAM role.

     Amazon Cognito identity pools assign your authenticated users a set of temporary, limited-privilege credentials to access your AWS resources. The permissions for each user are controlled through IAM roles that you create. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/role-based-access-control.html

     A makes no sense - Cognito is not accessing the S3 resource. It just returns the JWT token that will be attached to the S3 request.

D is the right answer, using custom attributes that are added to the JWT and used to grant permissions in S3. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/using-attributes-for-access-control-policy-example.html for an example.

     If we consider these statements:
1. For the first 30 days after upload, the objects will be accessed frequently
2.The objects will be used less frequently after 30 days, but the access patterns for each object will be inconsistent
3.The company must optimize its S3 storage costs while maintaining high availability and resiliency of stored assets.
4.The company uses multipart upload in parallel by using S3 APIs and overwrites if the same object is uploaded again.
Statements 1 and 2 cloudl be completed with option D  and not A because datas are infrequently accessed only after 30 days.
Due to usage of multipart upload, to meet requirement  regarding cost optimization, option B will be used to clean up buckets uncompleted file parts(statements 3 &amp; 4).

       Also, don't be confused by 30 days. The question has tricky wording: " The objects will be used less frequently after 30 days, but the access patterns for each object will be inconsistent"
It does NOT say that objects will be accessed less frequently after 30 days. It says the access is unpredictable which means it could go up or down. Don't make assumptions.

     C is nonsense
E does not meet the "high availability and resiliency" requirement
B is obvious (incomplete multipart uploads consume space -&gt; cost money)

The tricky part is A vs. D. However, 'inconsistent access patterns' are the primary use case for Intelligent-Tiering. There are probably objects that will never be accessed and that would be moved to Glacier Instant Retrieval by Intelligent-Tiering, thus the overall cost would be lower than with D.

     A. Move assets to S3 Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days.
B. Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads.

Explanation:

A. Moving assets to S3 Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days: This storage class automatically analyzes the access patterns of objects and moves them between frequent access and infrequent access tiers. Since the objects will be accessed frequently for the first 30 days, storing them in the frequent access tier during that period optimizes performance. After 30 days, when the access patterns become inconsistent, S3 Intelligent-Tiering will automatically move the objects to the infrequent access tier, reducing storage costs.

B. Configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads: Multipart uploads are used for large objects, and incomplete multipart uploads can consume storage space if not cleaned up. By configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads, unnecessary storage costs can be avoided.

A. Move assets to S3 Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days. This will automatically move objects between two access tiers based on changing access patterns and save costs by reducing the number of objects stored in the expensive tier.

B. Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads. This will help to reduce storage costs by removing incomplete multipart uploads that are no longer needed.

     Correct Answer A. Send the outbound connection from EC2 to Network Firewall. In Network Firewall, create stateful outbound rules to allow certain domains for software patch download and deny all other domains.

     Security Groups operate at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model and are primarily concerned with controlling traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. They do not have the capability to inspect or filter traffic based on URLs.
The solution to restrict outbound internet traffic based on specific URLs typically involves using a proxy or firewall that can inspect the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model, where URL information is available.
AWS Network Firewall operates at the network and application layers, allowing for more granular control, including the ability to inspect and filter traffic based on domain names or URLs.
By configuring domain list rule groups in AWS Network Firewall, you can specify which URLs are allowed for outbound traffic.
This option is more aligned with the requirement of allowing access to approved third-party software repositories based on their URLs.

"Web filtering:
AWS Network Firewall supports inbound and outbound web filtering for unencrypted web traffic. For encrypted web traffic, Server Name Indication (SNI) is used for blocking access to specific sites. SNI is an extension to Transport Layer Security (TLS) that remains unencrypted in the traffic flow and indicates the destination hostname a client is attempting to access over HTTPS. In addition, **AWS Network Firewall can filter fully qualified domain names (FQDN).**"
Always use an AWS product if the advertisement meets the use case.

     Implement strict inbound security group rules
Configure an outbound security group rule to allow traffic only to the approved software repository URLs
The key points:

Highly sensitive EC2 instances in private subnet that can access only approved URLs
Other internet access must be blocked
Security groups act as a firewall at the instance level and can control both inbound and outbound traffic.

     Option C is the best solution to meet the requirements of this scenario. Implementing strict inbound security group rules that only allow traffic from approved sources can help secure the VPC network that hosts Amazon EC2 instances. Additionally, configuring an outbound rule that allows traffic only to the authorized software repositories on the internet by specifying the URLs will ensure that only approved third-party software repositories can be accessed from the EC2 instances. This solution does not require any additional AWS services and can be implemented using VPC security groups.

Option A is not the best solution as it involves the use of AWS Network Firewall, which may introduce additional operational overhead. While domain list rule groups can be used to block all internet traffic except for the approved third-party software repositories, this solution is more complex than necessary for this scenario.

     In the security group, only allow inbound traffic originating from the VPC.  Then only allow outbound traffic with a whitelisted IP address.  The question asks about blocking EC2 instances, which is best for security groups since those are at the EC2 instance level.  A network firewall is at the VPC level, which is not what the question is asking to protect.

     The auto-scaling would increase the rate at which sales requests are "processed", whereas a SQS will ensure messages don't get lost.  If you were at a fast food restaurant with a long line with 3 cash registers, would you want more cash registers or longer ropes to handle longer lines?  Same concept here.

       As an architecture, it is not possible to add more backend workers (it is part of the HR and boss's job, not for architecture design the solution). So when the demand surge, the only correct choice is to buffer them using SQS so that workers can take their time to process it successfully

       "ensure that all the requests are processed successfully?"
we want to ensure success not the speed, even in the auto-scaling, there is the chance for the failure of the request but not in SQS- if it is failed in sqs it is sent back to the queue again and new consumer will pick the request.

     The problem states that the application consists of "static and dynamic front-end content." Static content typically includes cacheable resources such as HTML, CSS, and image files. Therefore, from this statement, one can infer that caching static content using CloudFront would improve performance. In other words, the mention of "static content" in the problem itself leads to the conclusion that CloudFront should be added for static content.

Additionally, the problem mentions "asynchronously processed backend workers." Asynchronous processing is well-suited for services like SQS, which can improve efficiency by handling dynamic requests that do not require immediate processing. The mention of "successfully processing all requests" also suggests that SQS is needed to ensure that all requests are handled properly.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

     Important question to answer D. Can you connect the website with SQS directly? How do you control access to who can put messages to SQS? I have never seen such a situation it has to be at least behind API gateway. So that conclusion brings me to answer B, application also can process async everything without SQS.

     I chose D because I love SQS! These questions are hammering SQS in every solution as a "protagonist" that saves the day. 
AC are clearly useless
B can work but D is better because of SQS being better than EC2 scaling. The other part is that backend workers process the request asynchronously therefore a queue is better.

     A and C don't solve anything so ignore them.
Between B and D, D guarantees the scaling via SQS and order processing. B can also do that but it is not guaranteed that EC2 scaling will work to process the order. 
As usual, I suspect that this "brain dump" may be missing critical wording to differentiate between the options so read carefully in the exam.

     There are two components that we need
* Frontend: Hosted on S3, performance can be increased with CloudFront
* Backend: There's no reason to process all the orders instantly, so we should decouple the processing from the API which we do with SQS

Thus D, CloudFront + SQS

     An SQS queue acts as a buffer between the frontend (website) and backend (API). Web requests can dump messages into the queue at a high throughput, then the queue handles delivering those messages to the API at a controlled rate that it can sustain. This prevents the API from being overwhelmed.

       Options A and B would help by scaling out more instances, however, this may not scale quickly enough and still risks overwhelming the API. Caching parts of the dynamic content (option C) may help but does not provide the buffering mechanism that a queue does.

     There is no clarity on what the asynchronous process is but D makes more sense if we want to process all requests successfully. The way the question is worded it looks like the msgs-&gt;SQS&gt;ELB/Ec2. This ensures that the messages are processed but may be delayed as the load increases.

It can be used to scan the EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can be used to patch the EC2 instances on a regular schedule. Together, these services can provide a solution that meets the requirements of running regular security scans and patching EC2 instances on a regular schedule.

     Amazon Inspector is a security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices. Amazon Inspector can be used to identify security issues and recommend fixes for them. It is an ideal solution for running regular security scans across a large fleet of EC2 instances.

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a service that helps you automate the process of patching Windows and Linux instances. It provides a simple, automated way to patch your instances with the latest security patches and updates. Patch Manager helps you maintain compliance with security policies and regulations by providing detailed reports on the patch status of your instances.

Secrets Manager stores actual secrets like passwords, pass phrases, and anything else you want encrypted. SM uses KMS to encrypt its secrets, it would be circular to get an encryption key from KMS to use SM to encrypt the encryption key.

     A is the correct solution to meet the requirement of encrypting the data at rest. 

To encrypt data at rest in Amazon RDS, you can use the encryption feature of Amazon RDS, which uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). With this feature, Amazon RDS encrypts each database instance with a unique key. This key is stored securely by AWS KMS. You can manage your own keys or use the default AWS-managed keys. When you enable encryption for a DB instance, Amazon RDS encrypts the underlying storage, including the automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots.

     A. Create a key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Enable encryption for the DB instances is the correct answer to encrypt the data at rest in Amazon RDS DB instances.

Amazon RDS provides multiple options for encrypting data at rest. AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is used to manage the keys used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Therefore, a solution architect should create a key in AWS KMS and enable encryption for the DB instances to encrypt the data at rest.

     Don't mix up between Mbps and Mbs. 
The proper calculation is:

10 MB/s x 86,400 seconds per day x 30 days/8 = 3,402,000 MB or approximately 3.4 TB

     (15/8) = 1.875 MB/s
1.875 MB/s x 0.7 = 1.3125 (70% NW utilization) MB/s
1.3125  MB/s x 3600 = 4725 MB (MB per 1 hour)
4725 x 24 = 113400 MB per 1 full day (24h)
113400 x 30 = 3402000 MB for 30 days 
3402000 / 1024 = 3322.265625 GB for 30 days

     ° 15 Mbps bandwidth with 70% max utilization limits the effective bandwidth to 10.5 Mbps or 1.31 MB/s.
° 20 TB of data at 1.31 MB/s would take approximately 193 days to transfer over the network. ° This far exceeds the 30 day requirement.
° AWS Snowball provides a physical storage device that can be shipped to the data center. Up to 80 TB can be loaded onto a Snowball device and shipped back to AWS.
This allows the 20 TB of data to be transferred much faster by shipping rather than over the limited network bandwidth.
° Snowball uses tamper-resistant enclosures and 256-bit encryption to keep the data secure during transit.
° The data can be imported into Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier once the Snowball is received by AWS.

     10 MB/s x 86,400 seconds per day x 30 days = 25,920,000 MB or approximately 25.2 TB

That's how much you can transfer with a 10 Mbps link (roughly 70% of the 15 Mbps connection).

With a consistent connection of 8~ Mbps, and 30 days, you can upload 20 TB of data.

My math says B, my brain wants to go with A. Take your pick.

     This solution addresses the need for secure access to confidential and sensitive files, as well as the increase in remote usage. Migrating the files to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides a scalable, fully managed file storage solution in the AWS Cloud that is accessible from on-premises and cloud environments. Integration with the on-premises Active Directory allows for a consistent user experience and centralized access control. AWS Client VPN provides a secure and managed VPN solution that can be used by employees to access the files securely.

       That's why we're using FSX for Windows File Server in AWS.

"Signed URL to allow download" would allow everyone who has the URL to download the files, but we must "ensure that the files can be accessed only by authorized users". Plus, the "private VPC endpoint" is not really of use here, it's still S3 and the users are not in AWS.

     B is the best solution for the given requirements. It provides a secure way for employees to access confidential and sensitive files from anywhere using AWS Client VPN. The Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system is designed to provide native support for Windows file system features such as NTFS permissions, Active Directory integration, and Distributed File System (DFS). This means that the company can continue to use their on-premises Active Directory to manage user access to files.

     By configuring a scheduled scaling policy, the EC2 Auto Scaling group can proactively launch additional EC2 instances before the CPU utilization peaks to 100%. This will ensure that the application can handle the workload during the month-end financial calculation batch, and avoid any disruption or downtime.

Configuring a simple scaling policy based on CPU utilization or adding Amazon CloudFront distribution or Amazon ElastiCache will not directly address the issue of handling the monthly peak workload.

     If the scaling were based on CPU or memory, it requires a certain amount of time above that threshhold, 5 minutes for example.  That would mean the CPU would be at 100% for five minutes.

     C: Configure an EC2 Auto Scaling scheduled scaling policy based on the monthly schedule is the best option because it allows for the proactive scaling of the EC2 instances before the monthly batch run begins. This will ensure that the application is able to handle the increased workload without experiencing downtime. The scheduled scaling policy can be configured to increase the number of instances in the Auto Scaling group a few hours before the batch run and then decrease the number of instances after the batch run is complete. This will ensure that the resources are available when needed and not wasted when not needed.

The most appropriate solution to handle the increased workload during the monthly batch run and avoid downtime would be to configure an EC2 Auto Scaling scheduled scaling policy based on the monthly schedule.

       Scheduled scaling policies allow you to schedule EC2 instance scaling events in advance based on a specified time and date. You can use this feature to plan for anticipated traffic spikes or seasonal changes in demand. By setting up scheduled scaling policies, you can ensure that you have the right number of instances running at the right time, thereby optimizing performance and reducing costs.

To set up a scheduled scaling policy in EC2 Auto Scaling, you need to specify the following:

Start time and date: The date and time when the scaling event should begin.

Desired capacity: The number of instances that you want to have running after the scaling event.

Recurrence: The frequency with which the scaling event should occur. This can be a one-time event or a recurring event, such as daily or weekly.

     AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that allows customers to transfer files over SFTP, FTPS, and FTP directly into and out of Amazon S3. It eliminates the need to manage any infrastructure for file transfer, which reduces operational overhead. Additionally, the service can be configured to use an existing Active Directory for authentication, which means that no changes need to be made to the customer's application.

     Enabling Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) fast snapshot restore on a snapshot allows you to
quickly create a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from a snapshot, which can help reduce the
initialization latency when provisioning new instances. Once the AMI is provisioned, you can replace
the AMI in the Auto Scaling group with the new AMI. This will ensure that new instances are launched
from the updated AMI and are able to meet the increased demand quickly.

     The question wording is pretty weird but the only thing of value is latency during initialisation which makes B the correct option.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-fast-snapshot-restore.html

A only helps with creating the AMI
C and D will probably work (ambiguous language) but won't handle initialising latency issues.

     Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) is a feature of Amazon EBS that automates the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots, which are used to back up your Amazon EBS volumes. With DLM, you can protect your data by implementing a backup strategy that aligns with your business requirements.

You can create lifecycle policies to automate snapshot management. Each policy includes a schedule of when to create snapshots, a retention rule with a defined period to retain each snapshot, and a set of Amazon EBS volumes to assign to the policy.

This service helps simplify the management of your backups, ensure compliance, and reduce costs.

     B. Enable Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) fast snapshot restore on a snapshot. Provision an AMI by using the snapshot. Replace the AMI in the Auto Scaling group with the new AMI.

Here's the reasoning:

    Amazon EBS Fast Snapshot Restore: This feature allows you to quickly create new EBS volumes (and subsequently AMIs) from snapshots. Fast Snapshot Restore optimizes the initialization process by pre-warming the snapshots, reducing the time it takes to create volumes from those snapshots.

    Provision an AMI using the snapshot: By using fast snapshot restore, you can efficiently provision an AMI from the pre-warmed snapshot, minimizing the initialization latency.

    Replace the AMI in the Auto Scaling group: This allows you to update the instances in the Auto Scaling group with the new AMI efficiently, ensuring that the new instances are launched with minimal delay.

       Option A (Use aws ec2 register-image command and AWS Step Functions): While this approach can be used to automate the creation of an AMI and update the Auto Scaling group, it may not offer the same level of optimization for initialization latency as Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore.

    Option C (Enable AMI creation and define lifecycle rules in Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager, create a Lambda function): While Amazon DLM can help manage the lifecycle of your AMIs, it might not provide the same level of speed and responsiveness needed for sudden increases in demand.

    Option D (Use Amazon EventBridge and AWS Backup): AWS Backup is primarily designed for backup and recovery, and it might not be as optimized for quickly provisioning instances in response to sudden demand spikes. EventBridge can be used for event-driven architectures, but in this context, it might introduce unnecessary complexity.

     Enabling Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) fast snapshot restore on a snapshot allows for rapid restoration of EBS volumes from snapshots. This reduces the time required to create an AMI from a snapshot, which is useful for quickly provisioning large Amazon EC2 instances.

Provisioning an AMI by using the fast snapshot restore feature is a fast and efficient way to create an AMI. Once the AMI is created, it can be replaced in the Auto Scaling group without any downtime or disruption to running instances.

     AWS Secrets Manager allows you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. With this service, you can automate the rotation of secrets, such as database credentials, on a schedule that you choose. The solution allows you to create a new secret with the appropriate credentials and associate it with the Aurora DB cluster. You can then configure a custom rotation period of 14 days to ensure that the credentials are automatically rotated every two weeks, as required by the IT security guidelines. This approach requires the least amount of operational effort as it allows you to manage secrets centrally without modifying your application code or infrastructure.

       How would adding a cache "reduce the replication lag" between the primary instance and the read replicas? Plus, it would require "changes to the application code" that we want to avoid. The "AWS Lambda functions" would create "ongoing operational overhead" that we're also asked to avoid.

Migrating the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL allows for improved replication performance and higher scalability compared to Amazon RDS for MySQL. Aurora Replicas provide faster replication, reducing the replication lag, and Aurora Auto Scaling ensures that there are enough Aurora Replicas to handle the incoming traffic. Additionally, Aurora MySQL native functions can replace the stored procedures, reducing the load on the database and improving performance.

Option B is not the best solution since adding an ElastiCache for Redis cluster does not address the replication lag issue, and the cache may not have the most up-to-date information. Additionally, replacing the stored procedures with AWS Lambda functions adds additional complexity and may not improve performance.

       I agree with your explanation. Additionally, considering the requirement that "the read replicas must lag no more than 1 second behind the primary DB instance," it's crucial to ensure that Elasticache for Redis also maintains this tight synchronization window. This implies that the main RDS instance would need to synchronize an additional database, potentially exacerbating lag during peak times rather than alleviating it.

       Option B is incorrect because it suggests using ElastiCache for Redis as a caching layer in front of the database, but this would not necessarily reduce the replication lag on the read replicas. Additionally, it suggests replacing the stored procedures with AWS Lambda functions, which may require significant changes to the application code.

     By using ElastiCache you avoid a lot of common issues you might encounter. ElastiCache is a database caching solution. ElastiCache Redis per se, supports failover and Multi-AZ. And Most of all, ElastiCache is well suited to place in front of RDS.

Migrating a database such as option A, requires operational overhead.

       Database migration is one-time work, NOT "operational overhead". Plus, RDS for MySQL to Aurora with MySQL compatibility is not a big deal, and "minimizes changes to the application code" as requested.

     Answer - A
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PostgreSQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can scale reads for your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance by adding read replicas to the instance. As with other Amazon RDS database engines, RDS for PostgreSQL uses the native replication mechanisms of PostgreSQL to keep read replicas up to date with changes on the source DB. For general information about read replicas and Amazon RDS, see Working with read replicas.

     Answer - A
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Replication.CrossRegion.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you begin
Before you can create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster that is a cross-Region read replica, you must turn on binary logging on your source Aurora MySQL DB cluster. Cross-region replication for Aurora MySQL uses MySQL binary replication to replay changes on the cross-Region read replica DB cluster.

       The question states " The DR plan must replicate data to a "secondary" AWS Region."

In addition to Aurora Replicas, you have the following options for replication with Aurora MySQL:

Aurora MySQL DB clusters in different AWS Regions.

You can replicate data across multiple Regions by using an Aurora global database. For details, see High availability across AWS Regions with Aurora global databases

You can create an Aurora read replica of an Aurora MySQL DB cluster in a different AWS Region, by using MySQL binary log (binlog) replication. Each cluster can have up to five read replicas created this way, each in a different Region.

       On this same URL you provided, there is a note highlighted, stating the following:
"Replication from the primary DB cluster to all secondaries is handled by the Aurora storage layer rather than by the database engine, so lag time for replicating changes is minimal—typically, less than 1 second. Keeping the database engine out of the replication process means that the database engine is dedicated to processing workloads. It also means that you don't need to configure or manage the Aurora MySQL binlog (binary logging) replication."

So, answer should be A

     MOST cost-effective --&gt; B
See section "Creating a headless Aurora DB cluster in a secondary Region" on the link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html
"Although an Aurora global database requires at least one secondary Aurora DB cluster in a different AWS Region than the primary, you can use a headless configuration for the secondary cluster. A headless secondary Aurora DB cluster is one without a DB instance. This type of configuration can lower expenses for an Aurora global database. In an Aurora DB cluster, compute and storage are decoupled. Without the DB instance, you're not charged for compute, only for storage. If it's set up correctly, a headless secondary's storage volume is kept in-sync with the primary Aurora DB cluster."

     I think Amazon is looking for D here.  I don' think A is intended because that would require knowledge of MySQL, which isn't what they are testing us on.  Not option C because the question states large volume.  If the volume were low, then DMS would be better.  This question is not a good question.

     D provides automatic replication to a secondary Region through the Aurora global database feature. This feature provides automatic replication of data across AWS Regions, with the ability to control and configure the replication process. By specifying a minimum of one DB instance in the secondary Region, you can ensure that your secondary database is always available and up-to-date, allowing for quick failover in the event of a disaster.

     C is a valid solution for securing the custom application with the least amount of programming effort. It involves creating credentials on the RDS for MySQL database for the application user and storing them in AWS Secrets Manager. The application can then be configured to load the database credentials from Secrets Manager. Additionally, the solution includes setting up a credentials rotation schedule for the application user in the RDS for MySQL database using Secrets Manager, which will automatically rotate the credentials at a specified interval without requiring any programming effort.

Protect against SQL injection and cross-site scripting
To protect your applications against SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, use the built-in SQL injection and cross-site scripting engines. Remember that attacks can be performed on different parts of the HTTP request, such as the HTTP header, query string, or URI. Configure the AWS WAF rules to inspect different parts of the HTTP request against the built-in mitigation engines.

     ° Use AWS WAF in front of the Application Load Balancer
° Configure appropriate WAF web ACLs to detect and block SQL injection patterns
The key points:
° Website hosted on EC2 behind an ALB with Aurora database
° Application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks
° AWS WAF is designed to detect and block SQL injection and other common web exploits. It can be placed in front of the ALB to inspect all incoming requests. WAF rules can identify malicious SQL patterns and block them.

     AWS WAF is a managed service that protects web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF enables customers to create custom rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection attacks.

By using AWS WAF in front of the ALB and associating the appropriate web ACLs with AWS WAF, the company can protect its website application from SQL injection attacks. AWS WAF will inspect incoming traffic to the website application and block requests that match the defined SQL injection patterns in the web ACLs. This will help to prevent SQL injection attacks from reaching the application, thereby improving the overall security posture of the application.

       B, C, and D are not the best solutions for this issue. Replying to SQL injections with a fixed response 
(B) is not a recommended approach as it does not actually fix the vulnerability, but only masks the issue. Subscribing to AWS Shield Advanced 
(C) is useful to protect against DDoS attacks but does not protect against SQL injection vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector 
(D) is a vulnerability assessment tool and can identify vulnerabilities but cannot block attacks in real-time.

     This solution leverages AWS Lake Formation to ingest data from the Aurora MySQL database into the S3 data lake, while enforcing column-level access control for QuickSight users. Lake Formation can be used to create and manage the data lake's metadata and enforce security and governance policies, including column-level access control. This solution then uses Amazon Athena as the data source in QuickSight to query the data in the S3 data lake. This solution minimizes operational overhead by leveraging AWS services to manage and secure the data, and by using a standard query service (Amazon Athena) to provide a SQL interface to the data.

answer B said "Set the appropriate desired capacity, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity". 
how can someone set desired capacity if he has no resources to analyze the required capacity.

     A scheduled scaling policy allows you to set up specific times for your Auto Scaling group to scale out or scale in. By creating a scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group, you can set the appropriate desired capacity, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity, and set the recurrence to weekly. You can then set the start time to 30 minutes before the batch jobs run, ensuring that the required capacity is provisioned before the jobs run.

Option C, creating a predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group, is not necessary in this scenario since the company does not have the resources to analyze the required capacity trends for the Auto Scaling group counts. This would require analyzing the required capacity trends for the Auto Scaling group counts to determine the appropriate scaling policy.

     How does C works with : transactions can vary, clearly C is designed for workloads that are predictable, if the transactions can vary then predictive scaling will not work. The only one that will work is scheduled since its based on time not workload intensity.

     From GPT4:
mong the provided options, creating a scheduled scaling policy (Option B) is the most direct and efficient way to ensure that the necessary capacity is provisioned 30 minutes before the weekly batch jobs run, with the least operational overhead. Here's a breakdown of Option B:

B. Create a scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. Set the appropriate desired capacity, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity. Set the recurrence to weekly. Set the start time to 30 minutes before the batch jobs run.

    Scheduled scaling allows you to change the desired capacity of your Auto Scaling group based on a schedule. In this case, setting the recurrence to weekly and adjusting the start time to 30 minutes before the batch jobs run will ensure that the necessary capacity is available when needed, without requiring manual intervention.

       yeah chatgpt told me this, so maybe dont take its word as gospel:

Upon reviewing the question again, it appears that the requirements emphasize the need to provision capacity 30 minutes before the batch jobs run and the company's constraint of not having resources to analyze capacity trends. In this context, the most suitable solution is C.

Predictive Scaling can use historical data to forecast future capacity needs.
Configuring the policy to scale based on CPU utilization with a target value of 60% aligns with the baseline CPU utilization mentioned in the scenario.
Setting instances to pre-launch 30 minutes before the jobs run provides the desired capacity just in time.

     Predictive scaling:  increases the number of EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group in advance of daily and weekly patterns in traffic flows. If you have regular patterns of traffic increases use predictive scaling, to help you scale faster by launching capacity in advance of forecasted load. You don't have to spend time reviewing your application's load patterns and trying to schedule the right amount of capacity using scheduled scaling. Predictive scaling uses machine learning to predict capacity requirements based on historical data from CloudWatch. The machine learning algorithm consumes the available historical data and calculates capacity that best fits the historical load pattern, and then continuously learns based on new data to make future forecasts more accurate.

     Use predictive scaling to increase the number of EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group in advance of daily and weekly patterns in traffic flows.

Predictive scaling is well suited for situations where you have:

Cyclical traffic, such as high use of resources during regular business hours and low use of resources during evenings and weekends

Recurring on-and-off workload patterns, such as batch processing, testing, or periodic data analysis

Applications that take a long time to initialize, causing a noticeable latency impact on application performance during scale-out events

     In general, if you have regular patterns of traffic increases and applications that take a long time to initialize, you should consider using predictive scaling. Predictive scaling can help you scale faster by launching capacity in advance of forecasted load, compared to using only dynamic scaling, which is reactive in nature.

     C: Migrate MySQL database to an Amazon Aurora global database is the best solution because it requires minimal operational overhead. Aurora is a managed service that provides automatic failover, so standby instances do not need to be manually configured. The primary DB cluster can be hosted in the primary Region, and the secondary DB cluster can be hosted in the DR Region. This approach ensures that the data is always available and up-to-date in multiple Regions, without requiring significant manual intervention.

     With dynamic scaling, the Auto Scaling group will automatically adjust the number of instances based on the actual workload. The target value for the CPU utilization metric is set to 60%, which is the baseline CPU utilization that is noted on each run, indicating that this is a reasonable level of utilization for the workload. This solution does not require any scheduling or forecasting, reducing the operational overhead.

     A. Use the Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java to host messages that are larger than 256 KB in Amazon S3.

Amazon SQS has a limit of 256 KB for the size of messages. To handle messages larger than 256 KB, the Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java can be used. This library allows messages larger than 256 KB to be stored in Amazon S3 and provides a way to retrieve and process them. Using this solution, the application code can remain largely unchanged while still being able to process messages up to 50 MB in size.

     Amazon Cognito is a serverless authentication service that can be used to easily add user sign-up and authentication to web and mobile apps. It is a good choice for this scenario because it is scalable and can handle a small number of users without any additional costs.

Lambda@Edge is a serverless compute service that can be used to run code at the edge of the AWS network. It is a good choice for this scenario because it can be used to perform authorization checks at the edge, which can improve the login latency.

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that can be used to serve web content globally. It is a good choice for this scenario because it can cache web content closer to users, which can improve the performance of the web application.

     Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that can securely deliver web content, videos, and APIs at scale. It integrates with Cognito for authentication and with Lambda@Edge for authorization, making it an ideal choice for serving web content globally.

Lambda@Edge is a service that lets you run AWS Lambda functions globally closer to users, providing lower latency and faster response times. It can also handle authorization logic at the edge to secure content in CloudFront. For this scenario, Lambda@Edge can provide authorization for the web application while leveraging the low-latency benefit of running at the edge.

     Amazon S3 File Gateway provides on-premises applications with access to virtually unlimited cloud storage using NFS and SMB file interfaces. It seamlessly moves frequently accessed data to a low-latency cache while storing colder data in Amazon S3, using S3 Lifecycle policies to transition data between storage classes over time.

In this case, the company's aging NAS array can be replaced with an Amazon S3 File Gateway that presents the same NFS and SMB shares to the client workstations. The data can then be migrated to Amazon S3 and managed using S3 Lifecycle policies

     Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a file interface to objects stored in S3. It can be used for a file-based interface with S3, which allows the company to migrate their NAS array data to S3 while maintaining the same look and feel for client workstations. Amazon S3 File Gateway supports SMB and NFS protocols, which will allow clients to continue to access the data using these protocols. Additionally, Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies can be used to automate the movement of data to lower-cost storage tiers, reducing the storage cost of inactive data.

     It provides an easy way to lift-and-shift file data from the existing NAS to Amazon S3. The S3 File Gateway presents SMB and NFS file shares that client workstations can access just like the NAS shares.
Behind the scenes, it moves the file data to S3 storage, storing it durably and cost-effectively.
S3 Lifecycle policies can be used to transition less frequently accessed data to lower-cost S3 storage tiers like S3 Glacier.
From the client workstation perspective, access to files feels seamless and unchanged after migration to S3. The S3 File Gateway handles the underlying data transfers.
It is a simple, low-cost gateway option tailored for basic file share migration use cases.

     Read Carefully guys , They need to be able to change FAMILY , and although EC2 Savings has a higher discount , its clearly documented as not allowed &gt; 

EC2 Instance Savings Plans provide savings up to 72 percent off On-Demand, in exchange for a commitment to a specific instance family in a chosen AWS Region (for example, M5 in Virginia). These plans automatically apply to usage regardless of size (for example, m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge, etc.), OS (for example, Windows, Linux, etc.), and tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default) within the specified family in a Region.

       Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that offer low prices on Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate usage, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or 3 year term. When you sign up for a Savings Plan, you will be charged the discounted Savings Plans price for your usage up to your commitment. 
The company wants savings over the next 3 years but wants to change the instance type in 6 months. This invalidates A

         Disregard! found more information:
We recommend Savings Plans (over Reserved Instances). Like Reserved Instances, Savings Plans offer lower prices (up to 72% savings compared to On-Demand Instance pricing). In addition, Savings Plans offer you the flexibility to change your usage as your needs evolve. For example, with Compute Savings Plans, lower prices will automatically apply when you change from C4 to C6g instances, shift a workload from EU (Ireland) to EU (London), or move a workload from Amazon EC2 to AWS Fargate or AWS Lambda.

EC2 Instance Savings Plans provide the lowest prices, offering savings up to 72% (just like Standard RIs) in exchange for commitment to usage of individual instance families 

Instance Savings "locks" you in that instance family which is not desired by the company hence A is the best plan as they can change the instance family anytime

     The most cost-effective solution that meets the company's requirements would be B. EC2 Instance Savings Plan.

EC2 Instance Savings Plans provide significant cost savings, allowing the company to commit to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1- or 3-year term, and in return, receive a discount on the hourly rate for the instances that match the attributes of the plan.

With EC2 Instance Savings Plans, the company can benefit from the flexibility to change the instance family and sizes over the next 3 years, which aligns with their requirement to adjust based on application popularity and usage.

This option provides the best balance of cost savings and flexibility, making it the most suitable choice for the company's needs.

Need to maximize cost savings over 3 years
Ability to change instance family and sizes in 6 months
Standardized on a particular instance family for now

     Savings Plans offer a flexible pricing model that provides savings on AWS usage. You can save up to 72 percent on your AWS compute workloads. Compute Savings Plans provide lower prices on Amazon EC2 instance usage regardless of instance family, size, OS, tenancy, or AWS Region. This also applies to AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda usage. SageMaker Savings Plans provide you with lower prices for your Amazon SageMaker instance usage, regardless of your instance family, size, component, or AWS Region.

       With an EC2 Instance Savings Plan, you can change your instance size within the instance family (for example, from c5.xlarge to c5.2xlarge) or the operating system (for example, from Windows to Linux), or move from Dedicated tenancy to Default and continue to receive the discounted rate provided by your EC2 Instance Savings Plan.

Therefore EC2 Instance Savings Plan prerequisites are not fulfilled

     C and D are impossible because you don't set or specify RCUs and WCUs in on-demand mode.
A is wrong because there is no indication of "infrequent access", and "the data workload is constant", there is no different between the current and the "forecasted" workload.

     predictable/constant =&gt; provisioned mode. On-demand mode is more suitable for workloads that are unpredictable and can vary widely from minute to minute.

The use case is not for Standard-IA which is described here: https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/standard-ia/

The data workload is constant and predictable making provisioned mode the best option.

     Option B lacks the cost benefits of Standard-IA.

Option C uses more expensive on-demand pricing.

Option D does not actually allow reserving capacity with on-demand mode.

So option A leverages provisioned mode, Standard-IA, and reserved capacity to meet the requirements in a cost-optimal way.

     Option C is the most cost-effective solution for this scenario. In on-demand mode, DynamoDB automatically scales up or down based on the current workload, so the company only pays for the capacity it uses. By setting the RCUs and WCUs high enough to accommodate changes in the workload, the company can ensure that it always has the necessary capacity without overprovisioning and incurring unnecessary costs. Since the workload is constant and predictable, using provisioned mode with reserved capacity (Options A and D) may result in paying for unused capacity during periods of low demand. Option B, using provisioned mode without reserved capacity, may result in throttling during periods of high demand if the provisioned capacity is not sufficient to handle the workload.

C  - Wouldn't recommended this option because using a different AWS managed KMS key will not allow the acquiring company's AWS account to access the encrypted data.

D.  - Don't risk it for a biscuit and get fired!!!! -  by downloading the database snapshot and uploading it to an Amazon S3 bucket. This will increase the risk of data leakage or loss of confidentiality during the transfer process.

     I believe the reason why option C is not the correct answer is that adding the acquiring company's AWS account to the KMS key alias doesn't directly control access to the encrypted data. KMS key aliases are simply alternative names for KMS keys and do not affect access control. Access to encrypted data is goverened by KMS key policies, which define who can use the key for encryption and decryption.

     To securely share a backup of the database with the acquiring company's AWS account in the same Region, a solutions architect should create a database snapshot, add the acquiring company's AWS account to the AWS KMS key policy, and share the snapshot with the acquiring company's AWS account.

Option A, creating an unencrypted snapshot, is not recommended as it will compromise the confidentiality of the data. Option C, creating a snapshot that uses a different AWS managed KMS key, does not provide any additional security and will unnecessarily complicate the solution. Option D, downloading the database snapshot and uploading it to an S3 bucket, is not secure as it can expose the data during transit.

Therefore, the correct option is B: Create a database snapshot. Add the acquiring company's AWS account to the KMS key policy. Share the snapshot with the acquiring company's AWS account.

     It is C, you have to create a new key. Read below
You can't share a snapshot that's encrypted with the default AWS KMS key. You must create a custom AWS KMS key instead. To share an encrypted Aurora DB cluster snapshot:

Create a custom AWS KMS key.
Add the target account to the custom AWS KMS key.
Create a copy of the DB cluster snapshot using the custom AWS KMS key. Then, share the newly copied snapshot with the target account.
Copy the shared DB cluster snapshot from the target account

       I also thought straight away that it could be C, however, the questions mentions that the database is encrypted with an AWS KMS custom key already. So maybe the letter B could be right, since it already has a custom key, not the default KMS Key.
What do you think?

     A and C are the correct choices.
B. It will not help improve the performance of the report process.
D. Migrating to RDS Custom does not address the issue of high availability and automatic recovery.
E. RDS Proxy can help with scalability and high availability but it does not address the issue of performance for the report process. Limiting the reporting requests to the maintenance window will not provide the required availability and recovery for the DB instance.

     The correct answers are A and C.

A. Modify the DB instance from a Single-AZ DB instance to a Multi-AZ deployment. This will provide high availability and automatic recovery for the DB instance. If the primary DB instance fails, the standby DB instance will automatically become the primary DB instance. This will ensure that the database is always available.

C. Create a read replica of the DB instance in a different Availability Zone. Point all requests for reports to the read replica. This will improve the performance of the report process by offloading the read traffic from the primary DB instance to the read replica. The read replica is a fully synchronized copy of the primary DB instance, so the reports will be accurate.

     Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks. A state machine is a workflow. A task is a state in a workflow that represents a single unit of work that another AWS service performs. Each step in a workflow is a state.
Depending on your use case, you can have Step Functions call AWS services, such as Lambda, to perform tasks.

     There are two main types of routers used in event-driven architectures: event buses and event topics. At AWS, we offer Amazon EventBridge to build event buses and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to build event topics.  https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/

     Step 3: Create a State Machine
Use the Step Functions console to create a state machine that invokes the Lambda function that you created earlier in Step 1.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/tutorial-creating-lambda-state-machine.html
In Step Functions, a workflow is called a state machine, which is a series of event-driven steps. Each step in a workflow is called a state.

     General
Q: What is AWS Global Accelerator?

A: AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that helps you improve the availability and performance of the applications that you offer to your global users. AWS Global Accelerator is easy to set up, configure, and manage. It provides static IP addresses that provide a fixed entry point to your applications and eliminate the complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Global Accelerator always routes user traffic to the optimal endpoint based on performance, reacting instantly to changes in application health, your user's location, and policies that you configure. You can test the performance benefits from your location with a speed comparison tool. Like other AWS services, AWS Global Accelerator is a self-service, pay-per-use offering, requiring no long term commitments or minimum fees.

     Global Accelerator supports the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), making it an excellent choice for an online multi-player game using UDP networking protocol. By setting up Global Accelerator with UDP listeners and endpoint groups in each Region, the network architecture can minimize latency and packet loss, giving end users a high-quality gaming experience.

     AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of applications with local or global users. Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

 Amazon RDS supports the use of Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS (io2) volumes. When creating a new DB instance or modifying an existing one, you can select the io2 volume type and specify the amount of IOPS and storage capacity required. RDS also supports the newer io2 Block Express volumes, which can deliver even higher performance for mission-critical database workloads.

     he most cost-effective solution that meets the requirements is to use a Multi-AZ deployment of an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with a General Purpose SSD (gp2) EBS volume. This solution will provide high availability and fault tolerance while minimizing disruptions and stabilizing performance. The gp2 EBS volume can handle up to 16,000 IOPS. You can also scale up to 64 TiB of storage.

Amazon RDS for MySQL provides automated backups, software patching, and automatic host replacement. It also provides Multi-AZ deployments that automatically replicate data to a standby instance in another Availability Zone. This ensures that data is always available even in the event of a failure.

     I thought the answer here is A. But when I found the link from Amazon website; as per AWS:

Amazon RDS provides three storage types: General Purpose SSD (also known as gp2 and gp3), Provisioned IOPS SSD (also known as io1), and magnetic (also known as standard). They differ in performance characteristics and price, which means that you can tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your database workload. You can create MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL RDS DB instances with up to 64 tebibytes (TiB) of storage. You can create SQL Server RDS DB instances with up to 16 TiB of storage. For this amount of storage, use the Provisioned IOPS SSD and General Purpose SSD storage types.

     for DB instances between 1 TiB and 4 TiB, storage is striped across four Amazon EBS volumes providing burst performance of up to 12,000 IOPS.

     The baseline IOPS performance of gp2 volumes is 3 IOPS per GB, which means that a 1 TB gp2 volume will have a baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS. However, the volume can also burst up to 16,000 IOPS for short periods, but this burst performance is limited and may not be sustained for long durations.
So, I am more prefer option A.

       If a 1 TB gp3 EBS volume is used, the maximum available IOPS according to calculations is 3000. This means that the storage can support a requirement of 1000 IOPS, and even 2000 IOPS if the requirement is doubled.
I am confusing between choosing A or B.

     Option A is the correct answer. A Multi-AZ deployment provides high availability and fault tolerance by automatically replicating data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone. This allows for seamless failover in the event of a primary instance failure. Using an io2 Block Express EBS volume provides the needed IOPS performance and capacity for the database. It is also designed for low latency and high durability, which makes it a good choice for a database tier.

     Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large number of open connections to the database server and may open and close database connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability. With RDS Proxy, failover times for Aurora and RDS databases are reduced by up to 66%.

C. Resize the RDS DB instance class to accept more connections? More connections means worse performance. Therefore, not correct.
D. Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB with on-demand scaling? DynamoDB is a noSQL database. Not correct.

     RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available, and scalable proxy for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) that makes it easy to connect to your RDS instances from applications running on AWS Lambda. RDS Proxy offloads the management of connections to the database, which can help to improve performance and reliability.

     The amount of CPU and memory resources required by the batch job exceeds the capabilities of AWS Lambda and Amazon Lightsail with AWS Auto Scaling, which offer limited compute resources. AWS Fargate offers containerized application orchestration and scalable infrastructure, but may require additional operational overhead to configure and manage the environment. AWS Batch is a fully managed service that automatically provisions the required infrastructure for batch jobs, with options to use different instance types and launch modes.

Therefore, the solution that will run the batch job within 15 minutes with the LEAST operational overhead is D. Use AWS Batch on Amazon EC2. AWS Batch can handle all the operational aspects of job scheduling, instance management, and scaling while using Amazon EC2 injavascript:void(0)stances with the right amount of CPU and memory resources to meet the job's requirements.

     The question needs to be phrased differently. I assume at first it was Lambda, because it says 15 minutes in the question which can be done. Yes it also does say CPU intensive however they go on with a full stop and then give you the server specs. It does not say it uses that much of the specs so they need to really rephrase the questions.

     The main reasons are:

AWS Batch can easily schedule and run batch jobs on EC2 instances. It can scale up to the required vCPUs and memory to match the on-premises server.
Using EC2 provides full control over the instance type to meet the resource needs.
No servers or clusters to manage like with ECS/Fargate or Lightsail. AWS Batch handles this automatically.
More cost effective and operationally simple compared to Lambda which is not ideal for long running batch jobs.

     S3 Glacier Deep Archive is intended for data that is rarely accessed and can tolerate retrieval times measured in hours. Moving data to S3 One Zone-IA immediately would not meet the requirement of immediate accessibility with the same high availability and resiliency.

     The answer should be C.
S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs), S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA.

Option B - Move the data objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days - will meet the requirements of keeping the data immediately accessible with high availability and resiliency, while minimizing storage costs. S3 Standard-IA is designed for infrequently accessed data, and it provides a lower storage cost than S3 Standard, while still offering the same low latency, high throughput, and high durability as S3 Standard.

     A because Elasticache, despite being ideal for leaderboards per Amazon, doesn't cache at edge locations.  D because FSx has higher performance for low latency needs.

https://www.techtarget.com/searchaws/tip/Amazon-FSx-vs-EFS-Compare-the-AWS-file-services

"FSx is built for high performance and submillisecond latency using solid-state drive storage volumes. This design enables users to select storage capacity and latency independently. Thus, even a subterabyte file system can have 256 Mbps or higher throughput and support volumes up to 64 TB."

     The reasons are:

Storing static files in S3 with CloudFront provides durability, high availability, and low latency by caching at edge locations.
FSx for Windows File Server provides a fully managed Windows native file system that can be accessed from the Windows EC2 instances to share server-side code. It is designed for high availability and scales up to 10s of GBPS throughput.
EFS and EBS volumes can be attached to a single AZ. FSx and S3 are replicated across AZs for high availability.

     Use a Lambda@Edge function with an external image management library. Associate the Lambda@Edge function with the CloudFront behaviors that serve the images.

Using a Lambda@Edge function with an external image management library is the best solution to resize the images dynamically and serve appropriate formats to clients. Lambda@Edge is a serverless computing service that allows running custom code in response to CloudFront events, such as viewer requests and origin requests. By using a Lambda@Edge function, it's possible to process images on the fly and modify the CloudFront response before it's sent back to the client. Additionally, Lambda@Edge has built-in support for external libraries that can be used to process images. This approach will reduce operational overhead and scale automatically with traffic.

     The correct answer is C.

A Lambda@Edge function is a serverless function that runs at the edge of the CloudFront network. This means that the function is executed close to the user, which can improve performance.
An external image management library can be used to resize images and to serve the appropriate format.
Associating the Lambda@Edge function with the CloudFront behaviors that serve the images ensures that the function is executed for all requests that are served by those behaviors.

     If the user asks for the most optimized image format (JPEG,WebP, or AVIF) using the directive format=auto, CloudFront Function will select the best format based on the Accept header present in the request.

     Option C is correct because it allows the compliance team to manage the KMS keys used for server-side encryption, thereby providing the necessary control over the encryption keys. Additionally, the use of the "aws:SecureTransport" condition on the bucket policy ensures that all connections to the S3 bucket are encrypted in transit.
option B might be misleading but using SSE-S3, the encryption keys are managed by AWS and not by the compliance team

     Macie does not encrypt the data like the question is asking
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/what-is-macie.html

Also, SSE-S3 encryption is fully managed by AWS so the Compliance Team can't administer this.

     D - Can't be because - Amazon Macie is a data security service that uses machine learning (ML) and pattern matching to discover and help protect your sensitive data.
Macie discovers sensitive information, can help in protection but can't protect

     Option A proposes creating a public SSL/TLS certificate in AWS Certificate Manager and associating it with Amazon S3. This step ensures that data is encrypted in transit. Then, the default encryption for each S3 bucket will be configured to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS), which will provide encryption at rest for the data stored in S3. In this solution, the compliance team will manage the KMS keys, ensuring that they control the encryption keys for data at rest.

     Option C seems to be the correct answer, option A is also close but ACM cannot be integrated with Amazon S3 bucket directly, hence, u can not attached TLS to S3. You can only attached TLS certificate to ALB, API Gateway and CloudFront and maybe Global Accelerator but definitely NOT EC2 instance and S3 bucket

     Correct Answer is "C"
“D” is not correct because Amazon Macie securely stores your data at rest using AWS encryption solutions. Macie encrypts data, such as findings, using an AWS managed key from AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).  However, in the question there is a requirement that the compliance team must administer the encryption key for data at rest.

     Option C will meet the requirements.

Explanation:

The compliance team needs to administer the encryption key for data at rest in order to ensure that protected health information (PHI) is encrypted in transit and at rest. Therefore, we need to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). The default encryption for each S3 bucket can be configured to use SSE-KMS to ensure that all new objects in the bucket are encrypted with KMS keys.

Additionally, we can configure the S3 bucket policies to allow only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS) using the aws:SecureTransport condition. This ensures that the data is encrypted in transit.

     We must provide encrypted in transit and at rest. Macie is needed to discover and recognize any PII or Protected Health Information. We already know that the hospital is working with the sensitive data ) so  protect them witn KMS and SSL. Answer D is unnecessary

     C [Correct]: Ensures Https only traffic (encrypted transit), Enables compliance team to govern encryption key.
D [Incorrect]: Misleading; PHI is required to be encrypted not discovered. Maice is a discovery service. (https://aws.amazon.com/macie/)

     Correct answer should be D. "Use Amazon Macie to protect the sensitive data..."
As requirement says "The hospitals's compliance team must ensure that all protected health information (PHI) is encrypted in transit and at rest."

Macie protects personal record such as PHI. Macie provides you with an inventory of your S3 buckets, and automatically evaluates and monitors the buckets for security and access control. If Macie detects a potential issue with the security or privacy of your data, such as a bucket that becomes publicly accessible, Macie generates a finding for you to review and remediate as necessary.

     an interface endpoint is a horizontally scaled, redundant VPC endpoint that provides private connectivity to a service. It is an elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to the AWS service. Interface endpoints are used to connect VPCs with AWS services

     B. Use an interface endpoint.

Here's the reasoning:

    Interface Endpoint (Option B): An interface endpoint (also known as VPC endpoint) allows communication between resources in your VPC and services without traversing the public internet. In this case, you can create an interface endpoint for API Gateway in your VPC. This enables the communication between the BuyStock and CheckFunds RESTful web services within the VPC, and it doesn't require significant changes to the code.

    X-API-Key header (Option A): Adding an X-API-Key header for authorization doesn't address the issue of ensuring that the APIs communicate through the VPC. It's more related to authentication and authorization mechanisms.

     The question here is that the BuyStock RESTful web service calls the CheckFunds RESTful web service through API gateway (internet), not directly. How does API gateway connect the services BuyStock and CheckFunds? It connects the Interface Endpoint of the services through Privatelink. The interface endpoints provide direct connection between services within the same private subnet. Answer B is correct.

     Answer B (from abylead)
With API GW, you can create multiple prv REST APIs, only accessible with an interface VPC endpt. To allow/ deny simple or cross acc access to your API from selected VPCs &amp; its endpts, you use resource plcys. In addition, you can also use DX for a connection between onprem network to VPC or your prv API.
API GW to VPC: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-private-apis.html

Less correct &amp; incorrect (infeasible &amp; inadequate) answers:
A)X-API-Key in HTTP header for authorization needs auto-process fcts &amp; changes: inadequate.
C)VPC GW endpts for S3 or DynamDB aren't for RESTful svcs: infeasible.
D)SQS que between 2 REST APIs needs endpts &amp; some changes: inadequate.

     The only time where an Interface Endpoint may be preferable (for S3 or DynamoDB) over a Gateway Endpoint is if you require access from on-premises, for example you want private access from your on-premise data center
