The Specialist is unsure of what happened, as the model has not changed from its initial deployment over a year ago.Which method should the Specialist try to improve model performance?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											The model needs to be completely re-engineered because it is unable to handle product inventory changes.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											The model's hyperparameters should be periodically updated to prevent drift.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											The model should be periodically retrained from scratch using the original data while adding a regularization term to handle product inventory changes
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											The model should be periodically retrained using the original training data plus new data as product inventory changes.
   </li>

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   A telecommunications company is developing a mobile app for its customers. The company is using an Amazon SageMaker hosted endpoint for machine learning model inferences.Developers want to introduce a new version of the model for a limited number of users who subscribed to a preview feature of the app. After the new version of the model is tested as a preview, developers will evaluate its accuracy. If a new version of the model has better accuracy, developers need to be able to gradually release the new version for all users over a fixed period of time.How can the company implement the testing model with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Update the ProductionVariant data type with the new version of the model by using the CreateEndpointConfig operation with the InitialVariantWeight parameter set to 0. Specify the TargetVariant parameter for InvokeEndpoint calls for users who subscribed to the preview feature. When the new version of the model is ready for release, gradually increase InitialVariantWeight until all users have the updated version.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Configure two SageMaker hosted endpoints that serve the different versions of the model. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to both endpoints based on the TargetVariant query string parameter. Reconfigure the app to send the TargetVariant query string parameter for users who subscribed to the preview feature. When the new version of the model is ready for release, change the ALB's routing algorithm to weighted until all users have the updated version.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Update the DesiredWeightsAndCapacity data type with the new version of the model by using the UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities operation with the DesiredWeight parameter set to 0. Specify the TargetVariant parameter for InvokeEndpoint calls for users who subscribed to the preview feature. When the new version of the model is ready for release, gradually increase DesiredWeight until all users have the updated version.

   <strong>
    Question:
   </strong>
   A manufacturing company uses machine learning (ML) models to detect quality issues. The models use images that are taken of the company's product at the end of each production step. The company has thousands of machines at the production site that generate one image per second on average.The company ran a successful pilot with a single manufacturing machine. For the pilot, ML specialists used an industrial PC that ran AWS IoT Greengrass with a long-running AWS Lambda function that uploaded the images to Amazon S3. The uploaded images invoked a Lambda function that was written in Python to perform inference by using an Amazon SageMaker endpoint that ran a custom model. The inference results were forwarded back to a web service that was hosted at the production site to prevent faulty products from being shipped.The company scaled the solution out to all manufacturing machines by installing similarly configured industrial PCs on each production machine. However, latency for predictions increased beyond acceptable limits. Analysis shows that the internet connection is at its capacity limit.How can the company resolve this issue MOST cost-effectively?
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A.
												
											
											Set up a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection between the production site and the nearest AWS Region. Use the Direct Connect connection to upload the images. Increase the size of the instances and the number of instances that are used by the SageMaker endpoint.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Extend the long-running Lambda function that runs on AWS IoT Greengrass to compress the images and upload the compressed files to Amazon S3. Decompress the files by using a separate Lambda function that invokes the existing Lambda function to run the inference pipeline.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Use auto scaling for SageMaker. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the production site and the nearest AWS Region. Use the Direct Connect connection to upload the images.
   </li>
   <li>
    D.
												
											
											Deploy the Lambda function and the ML models onto the AWS IoT Greengrass core that is running on the industrial PCs that are installed on each machine. Extend the long-running Lambda function that runs on AWS IoT Greengrass to invoke the Lambda function with the captured images and run the inference on the edge component that forwards the results directly to the web service.

    Question:
   </strong>
   A real-estate company is launching a new product that predicts the prices of new houses. The historical data for the properties and prices is stored in .csv format in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data has a header, some categorical fields, and some missing values. The company's data scientists have used Python with a common open-source library to fill the missing values with zeros. The data scientists have dropped all of the categorical fields and have trained a model by using the open-source linear regression algorithm with the default parameters.The accuracy of the predictions with the current model is below 50%. The company wants to improve the model performance and launch the new product as soon as possible.Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

Perform the inferences.
   </li>
   <li>
    B.
												
											
											Create an Amazon SageMaker notebook with a new IAM role that is associated with the notebook. Pull the dataset from the S3 bucket. Explore different combinations of feature engineering transformations, regression algorithms, and hyperparameters. Compare all the results in the notebook, and deploy the most accurate configuration in an endpoint for predictions.
   </li>
   <li>
    C.
												
											
											Create an IAM role with access to Amazon S3, Amazon SageMaker, and AWS Lambda. Create a training job with the SageMaker built-in XGBoost model pointing to the bucket with the dataset.
